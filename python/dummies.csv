"**UPDATE MARCH2021**Decent for a USB 2.0 Device but don't expect anything above SBC *FALSE*aptX,Works very well, for Linux too,Using it to connect with ps5 controller on pc, no issues !,Not bad,Nice product with some cons,Overall good product 👌,Okay if on tight budget,Nice",This is the Update MARCHI want to make a huge point to anyone who doesnt get good distance may I suggest purchasing either of the extension cables because they are what I use and they work greatFEDUS USB Male A to Female A Extension Cable orStorite Pack USB Male A To Female A Extension CableI have my extension cable from

have not discovered a way to switch between SBCaptX like Smartphones It automatically connects as aptXSOME HEADSETS may not work properlyMy Brandnew Tribit QuietPlus Headphones DID NOT work well at

Laptop speakers Bluetooth Audio Renderer Stereo and Bluetooth Hands Free Audio MonoClick on Bluetooth Audio Renderer Stereo wait a few seconds for it to complyNow your headset should be connectedIn watching Youtube I do get some lag but with different headsets the lag increases or decreasesThe same with me using VLC or Windows Media Player Sometimes if I stop the video app and restart then it will be no lagI dont use ZOOMTeamsSkype so I cannot test how the mic setup would functionAny one that has any input for this please use any or all of my post and add to it This would be helpful to alot of peopleFIRST post So for a few months I was using it strictly thru Win utilizing Win drivers and bluetooth connection page thru SettingsSystem But a few times i tried to use with music streaming to Sony XB or Oneplus Buds Wireless Bass edition and there would be intermittant drops Also when it came to pairing and connecting it would consistanly slow down my HP AMD A chipset laptop Also anytime I took the dongle out it would also affect disconnect my thumbdrive So I assumed it was a throttling going on with my USB ports I have Sandisk Dual Drive WD Passport DVi to HDMI and Logitech dongle So one by one i disconnected everything and left the BT dongle and it was a little betterSo I checked the TP Link India site for any FAQ related When I searched in the DownloadsDrivers section there was software driver present So I downloaded installed it and Win taskbar shows BT icon to use theBT Dongle The Driver software is by CSR Harmony Wireless Software Stack Version Once installed there are more options that can be accessed thru the BT icon in taskbar The BT icon sits in the system tray as before Audio transmission can be switched between stereo and mono Also if your playing a video or audio file and you start the pairing process once connected there will be slight pause then it connects to the output in stereo It works really well I purchased a long usb male to female cable and now i have a little bit more increase in connection distance I have not tried this for transfer of files If and when I find a need to do so I will updatefor now at this price point it gives me freedom to connect my BT audio gear instead of purchasing a more expensive unit to give my laptop BT capabilites and this is as small if not smaller than some thumbdrives Oh and I also purchased a seperate QZ Powered USB hub for my drives So the only USB devices connected are the Dongle and the hub Now when I disconnect the BT dongle my drives stay connectedI hope this information is helpful I tried not to make it too long but it happened If any questions arise please drop me a line and I will respond with whatever help I can giveTP link products usually work wellwhile longevity with continuous use may vary but these devices are not intended for prolonged or continuous useI have had multiple to link devices ranging from wifi adapters routers range extenders etcNow I have tried this Bluetooth adapterProsMinuscule size you can keep attached to the device not noticeableBut not recommended to do soas its usually set to discoverable during setup and it has decent rangeso if one is too skeptical might lead to security issues although the hacker will have to be in the same house probablyRange is decentworks good in the same roomthis kind of device is usually meant for local connectivity usually without barriersI use it to connect headphones to the PC and it works nicely for thatI earlier had a Bluetooth adapter from enter and that worked well too except for the range and bandwidth required nowadays has increasedso some choppy audio did occur with todays high quality audios and that got managed with this Bluetooth adapternice clean audioLastly it works nicely with Linuxi use debian based Ubuntuand its almost plug and playI did have blueman Bluetooth manager installed from the previous adapter I had And when I plugged it ini didnt have to do anything elseSo unlike what the site says about only windows it definitely works with LinuxI cant say if the version UB will work thoughWhile installing the driver in windows I noticed it was installing CSR stackAnd CSR original chip there are many fake ones is known to work with Linuxso maybe thats why it worked wellComing to windows i have winI had bluesoleil preinstalled and it worked with itDidnt have to install any driver separatelyBut there is a driver available in their site for xpIn win and above its supposed to be plug and playSo no issues thereNow the consA bit high price than rest of the companies probably can improve on thati bought it for Audio quality is good but somehow compared to my enter Bluetooth stackThe audio was a bit mutedhad to increase the volume higher to reach the same level of loudnessbut even then i feel a slight reduction in the dynamic range of the audio no idea if thats a software or hardware issueencodingdecoding issueIts not very noticeable specially of someone doesnt have anything to compare withLastly the windows driver is MBgranted it has both and versionsbut each one is almost MBThats way to big for a driver of these devicesNeither bluesoleilblueman cross MBSo I dont know what is being packaged in those driversAlso somehow the driver didnt have a clean install in my system something to do with incorrect loading of c libraryIt didnt matter as I already had another driver installedOverall a nifty little deviceI have no need for Bluetooth as i dont have any device that requires itI just needed a adapter to solve the bandwidth problemand that purpose is nicely served and that it works both in win and linux is very helpfulDoes the job well few consHence one star lessUsing it for weeks Just plug it install drivers and you are good to go Seem less connection with ps controller Latency is very low around ms So basically connection is even faster than wired connection ms But when I simultaneously connect airpods gen the sound output was very weak it was muffled But it serves my main purpose with ps controller Apparently it seems like its the most relevant Bluetooth adapter out there good connectivity and all sort of stuffs like that generally comes in a BT adapters Id say the only con is the installation part it took a while figure out which was their website and drivers of ub aside from this everything is fabulousVery easy to install connectivity is also good but sometimes while using Bluetooth earphones sound cracks also Bluetooth sharing is quite slow thats allOtherwise th product is very good Easy to install I mean just plug in Connectivity is on all point but time i feel fumble issues sound quality is all depends on your wireless speakerIf you are tight budget its okay then Otherwise if can spend extra go for BT version Much better in both range and connectivityLike,4.3,B098K3H92Z,0,1,1,1,0,1,6,15,16,6,409.170.984.455.958
"Mediocre,Best in Budget and Beast in Quality,Best quality this product,Ear phone With Jack,Nice,good,Good sound quality,Value for money!",Recieved damaged product the first time the seller is very good and quickly replaced it for a new one Go for bassheads if you are spending this much They are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable The angled jack is a plus but the sound quality is soso Infinity zip and their own bassheads are way better for soundI would like to start by saying Im not an audiophile therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product First off this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it its good enough that I will buy it a third time if need beUpon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of pair of extra ear buds There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement More on this laterComing to the ear phones itself its among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand It is very durable specially the plug part that connects to your phone many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones This is not the case with theseThe wire itself is made of rubbersilicon It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasnt showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphonesRemember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin I dont know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume personally this problem didnt affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breakerMic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience In my opinion I feel that the quality is average it wont blow anyones mind but it will deliver most of the time A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads Finally the most important part of the review the sound quality of the ear phones As I said earlier I wont be going into the technical details I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half its total volume when listening to music The clarity of the boAt BassHeads are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much A point to remember as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones This becomes a double edged sword on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used The find unlike the ones find in lets say the newer Bose ear phones arent as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged timeLast but not the least there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads including red black and blue I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color This leaves out the red for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they lastPros No metal build Excellent wire quality and trendy Durable Above average sound qualityCons Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads All suggestions are welcomeThanking you DwarakeshBest quality I like boat earphone saund qualityOnly disadvantage I noticed was this cant be use in USB phones mm jack is provided so it can be usedin Jack phones only NicegoodI used this headphone for travel Very lite and easy to carry in pocket colourful Sound quality is good The wire is thin so i feel cautious While taking it from bag or pocketGd one Only thing is coverssleeves comes out easily if not gd fit However additional coverssleeves are provided,4.1,B07KY3FNQP,1,0,1,1,1,0,10,13,13,11,409.170.984.455.958
"Decent Product at about right price.,Seems good.,Good Quality & Durable Powerbank in 1k range | Review,This is the second power bank from Ambrane India, i am happy,It’s heavy but good,Good product,Good power bank,The power is bulkier",I bought this powerbank to use during my vacation with family It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging The speed of charging is alright and appropriate The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the PowerBank itself without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buyBit heavy but does its job Takes tooooooo much time to charge Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank chargingI needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity So this time I thought to give Ambrane a try as i already have Honor MI power banks mAh ones Though it was not a perfect match for MI or Honor ones iit did live up to my expectations for the k range INSIDE BOX Powerbank MicroUSB cable Carry pouch depends on which package you received more below User manualWarranty card General leaflet Feedback leaflet SOME DETAILS Mfg October Charging time Hrs Min via W charger low battery indication to full charge Backup Was able to charge Redmi Note pros Mah battery times with regular usage in between PROS High capacity power bank with dual input micro USB or USB C Dual output via USB ports Not a fast chargequick charge device but has an output of VA W which is good enough Touch button for power checks or switch it on for charging device It comes with a carry pouch more below on this part Compact form factor sturdy design with ABS body CONS It does not autostart charging when the device is connected Since it has a touch button instead of pushbutton it activates accidentally switching it on every time during handling There is a lot of conversion loss backup is slightly less for a mAh power bank Cons are significant enough to reduce star There is scope for improvement points in this product in the same range So device LED STATUS stndrdth LED blinking while charging power bank Status of charge in terms of no of LEDs blinking LEDs solid white while charging other devices Status of remaining battery in terms of no of LEDs One blinking while charging other devices Low battery All LED solid glow Battery fully charged AMBRANE BOX DEBATE When i first received this power bank it came in a small box approx xxcm Mfg Aug with everything forced in congested space The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch When replacement came it came in a polywrapped bigger box xx cm Mfg Oct with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening Looked like it was applied with an open box So its presence was useless This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch CARRY POUCH As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit Neither loose nor tight Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon VERDICT At the price point its not a bad deal Its a midway path bw low quality and highquality ones You can very well go for Ambrane as it makes good quality durable power banks Rest nothing is perfect in this world For this thing only days replacement policy from Amazon and year warranty from Ambrame is available If one can extend the budget by a few hundred MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body better quality overall I have MI Honor Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be from low to high Ambrane Honor MII am putting up this review after day of usage This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family Before to this i have bought their PP mah model and also has MI i mah power bank both were really good here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after day of usage and also a little bit of comparison My dad uses Redmi note my mom has MI A and i am using Redmi note Pros Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you dont need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family out of has the same Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP Solid and sturdy built mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries this i came to know while buying this product cheaper price than MI Touch button at the top to know the power status this is something unique It took less than hour to charge my redmi note from to at cell battery indicator which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro I dont know either it is pro or con both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at Amp but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dads Redmi note which supports QC either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP power bank it kind of heats up the phone also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at ampCons Very stuffy packaging it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box It has some adhesive tape at the top i dont know why which when you remove it puts scratches on the top be careful while removing the same No torch light their PP have it only micro cable inside the boxDefinitely heavy but I knew this I will recommend this as it has slots so we can charge two phonesNice productPower backup is good but the USB cable provided is very bad It stopped working after few months of usageEverything is good but the battery dont last that long when use for charging two

"Excellent Phone in the budget segment,Best value for money... But afraid of future MIUI updates.,Don't purchase it as camera phone 😤,Dependable & it's been a year.,Budget mobile,Good for basic use,Phone is nice , but software is not",I was looking for a phone below K I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones My requirement was a phone that has good network reception good wifi reception a balanced software good battery life good screen that dont strain eyes a good hardware mm headphone jack and a charger i dont need G network because G drains battery a lot and G spends too much data I dont watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD K K videos over mobile network For downloading documents social networks banking apps G is more than enoughIn my budget I found all phones have gb RAM Realme Narzo was during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note with gb RAM at gb RAM is always preferred over gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away So this was the only option I knew then availableRedmi note has AMOLED Display I am not bothered with Hz HzHz I keep the refresh rate at Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter All my Desktop screen has Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a Hz screen I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you dont need that Display size is inch it could have been better if it were inch I prefer big display phone Redmi note has that big display A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth The screen has a punch hole camera which looks goodThis phone duel speakers One is more powerful at bottom and another on top But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good What more do you expect from such tiny speakersThe phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor still I get good signal and never disconnected Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phoneThe phone has mAh battery and comes with W charger which is a bonus at this price point The battery gives long backup With good mobile network you can use it for days without charging using basic features like phone sms email FB WA etc But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below The phone has SD processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag The experience is butter smooth However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I dont have to clear RAM manually However after Android update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared SD doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient Because of that battery drains very little and W charger charges phone within mins for my usage The cable is USB A to C and feels goodThis phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailableThis phone has DDRX RAM and UFS storage The RAM is GB and can be expanded additional GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life This has Sim SD card slot Which is a great Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregationThe phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones And I have no problem with plastic I dont think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap I am happy with plastic back The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month This is inherent chemistry of TPU and no one can prevent this chemical degradation How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlightThe fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly The touch screen is excellent tooHowever I dont like some of the preinstalled apps Some can be uninstalled a few cant especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store I dont like them However I like the pre installed security app There is no ad in notification and all can be easily disabled Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good Does not show pictures like MP camera I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note back camera MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the userSo I give Redmi a score of This is an excellent phone the I got at during Great Indian festival I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone This phone is not for gamers or people who watch K k videos or shoot such things This is not or those who are crazy for G Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment days usage Good battery LIFE Bqest for dayday use W charger also good Best display but shouldve hz instead of Sturdy inhand feel Stereo speaker is loud and crisp split Camera above average But good concerning the price Buggy UIminor as expected But ui all way better than bloody MIUI G chipset SD which is fine G always available Some minor issue with WiFi reception Dont know may be they will fix it through OTA THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE THERE CASUAL GAMER BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWSMOVIES NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMINGNOT FOR PUBG COD LOVERSThe first look of this starbust design is eye catchyno word to express its designin hand feel and and its all physical dimension the second this which impress me its battery backupeven you playing game hardly for a long timeit gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also W is also a good deal at this price The third impressive factor is its dual speakerI have an another phone of k and the sound quality is almost same as it Media playback experience is also enhanced by its amoled display very colour charming display literally the display quality is unbeatable The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point Fingerprint button is also very responsive All other things and features are good to the price pointOnly one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower gradeeven my old Redmi Y which I exchanged with this had better camera than this So plz I request you to all dont buy this for camerajust dont The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to meI dont recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phoneIf you are non camera user then you will surely go for itPros design inhand feel battery and charging amoled displaydual speakerCons cameraQuite a smooth daily driver phone The overall experience has been satisfactory cameras good durability also seems to be good Ive dropped it quite a few times the gorilla glass seems to be holding up hz feels great Charging speed is good too nothing mindblowing though Battery life is decent Lasts quite a bit but since I keep it in the hz mode all the time its a little less for me But I dont have any problem with battery life for nowIt does what the description saysCamera quality not upto the mark compared to other redmi mobiles Even A model clicks better picsFinger print sensor is same as that of the lock button You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint

"Excellent Phone in the budget segment,Best value for money...

how many does watch FHD K K videos over mobile network For downloading documents social networks banking apps G is more than enoughIn my budget I found all phones have gb RAM Realme Narzo was during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note with gb RAM at gb RAM is always preferred over gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away So this was the only option I knew then availableRedmi note has AMOLED Display I am not bothered with Hz HzHz I keep the refresh rate at Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter All my Desktop screen has Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a Hz screen I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you dont need that Display size is inch it could have been better if it were inch I prefer big display phone Redmi note has that big display A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth The screen has a punch hole camera which looks goodThis phone duel speakers One is more powerful at bottom and another on top But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good What more do you expect from such tiny speakersThe phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor still I get good signal and never disconnected Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phoneThe phone has mAh battery and comes with W charger which is a bonus at this price point The battery gives long backup With good mobile network you can use it for days without charging using basic features like phone sms email FB WA etc But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below The phone has SD processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag The experience is butter smooth However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I dont have to clear RAM manually However after Android update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared SD doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient Because of

"Works as expected but some things can improve,I am using this more than 1 year,Overall its a good product, very useful.Some minor drawbacks.,Great for vacuum, bad for mopping,Good product.,Product service issues,Good product,A helping hand for working women",My review of using new Vacuum Mop Pro for days The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals They dont mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup for the app and robot to work together This tip is missing in user manual WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range GHz connection does not work with this model The robot takes anywhere between minutes to completely vaccum my sq ft house Battery life is really good in the new model or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house Charging is also not bad It took hrs for it to charge full the first time Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times it would not repeat this behavior Dusting is of A quality Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering We never knew we had so much dust in our house Mopping is average I would call it light wiping and not mopping Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps Vacuum Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness In this mode mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick upI recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house This is not ideal So its important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping The mop works horribly on door mats main door or bathroom mats It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place So please remove all the mats esp during mopping session Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode Sometimes we dont even know where it has gone it gets so quietPros Battery life Suction power Noise levels VacuumingCons Mopping is average Its at best can be called as light wiping Setup is bit tricky user manual is insufficient Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home You have to figure it out using YouTube videos I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing Once the device is confused it doesnt correct itself automatically It needs a map reset Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before moppingSuch tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your ownBut I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house cleanProsFor cleaning dust it is very good we can set daily scheduleeven if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule cleaning the box after its work is also not very hecticbrushes are providingWe can set restricted areasConesMost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush little difficult to clear the brushIt has been more than year iam using thisOne time the movement is low when icheckedso many hairs are stucked in its wheelit was little difficult to clear the hair strandsMopping it is average onlyonly takes very little amount of waterso oily things will remain in the flooronce or twice in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizolIt cant reach the sharp corners alsoOnce we create restricted areaby the time of using it couldnt detect the proper area we markedso it enter those area and get stuck most of the timesit is main thing I hate about this productremaining things are okaythen we have to reset the map and set restricted area againit is bit annoyingOverall it is very good for memy brooming is almost completely replaced by this once in week I do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didnt covered by this machine In all other aspect like price batteryapp feature suction and cleaning its really very good productI find it very useful and nice to have productSo will directly make note of some drawbacksimprovent area i observed Sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle Its little noisy or I will say not a silent thing in standard suction power though that with any vaccuum cleaner Xiaomi could have provides extra Hepa filter with it vaccummop doesnt clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush so I do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option Charging is super slow if compared with any mAh battery with mobile fast charger its times slower despite such a big docking chargerI am a bachelor and i do not like Maid coming to my housethis solves the purpose It is great at vacuuming my Sqft house It can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life It collects way more dust than the manual broomingIt can skip corners and narrow places Once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on for navigation and room mappingMopping is equally bad Mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor Also water tank broke in just few cleaningsRecommended for vacuuming purposeVery good product Very helpful product in my homeWe purchased the product in April and now it is not workingAfter charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stoppedEasy to use and Working well little bit of noise is there but acceptableHelping hand More reliable than maids Does the job well Once in days you need to mop yourself Good suction

"the only ANDROID tablet that makes sense in the non-sense tab market of India.,An impressive tablet for Android (at last),All good but miner bugs just don't upgrade it to 13.0.6.. New update details given,good tablet",first i would like to comment on the tab market of India the most peculiar thing I have seen in India is when a particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the USA you watch the prices of chromebooks tablets back to school offers in the US and compare them to India and it feels extremely unbalanced after the pandemic there was a huge surge in the tab market and tier brands started delivering garbage for rupees snapdragon old mediatek gb ram abysmal non ips screen for k just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students THIS TABLET BRINGS THE REVOLUTIONI am no student but bought this for day to day use and I am an user of the normal big bezel th gen iPad so my review will be comparative in nature also i bought this at rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price I paid if you are planning to buy an iPad just buy it considering gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updatesthis tablet if compared spec vs spec give a good challenge to the ipad FOR K RUPEES even for k it is fine build is fine although I put a tempered glass on the st day itself back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy the IPS screen is really good there is no backlight bleeding no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background I am used to OLED screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but OLED is impossible at this price the screen is better than my th gen iPads display it is brighter has more punchy colours blacks are darker on top of that hz panel hdr certification dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption it would be a great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet snapdragon is fine in a market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market hence I say if you dont want this just buy an iPad but dont buy any other android tablet at k price point all are trash was fine with all those games which rule the market today it has less pixels to push than in a phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless i cant comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now i dont see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming it has a watt charger in the box although it does support watt charging the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my iPad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has a bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers the camera is okayish just like most tablet cameras the iPad has even worse cameras for document scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in k range tablets the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers they are loud have depth are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost k they will hit you as a massive surprise i did not at all expect such good speakers they seriously outmatch those cheapo Rs boat goat mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes separation and low end of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantitycoming to the cons was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldnt find a place for a mm jack not even a dongle in the box they should seriously stop copying apples wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates although I mitigated the issue by using portable dongle DACs like shanling ua ibasso dcetc which i generally use with even my phones and my PC coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some LG phones with quad dac i am an audio enthusiast so i spend money on such products and you need not although it works with my old MI A dongle just fine for rupees I dont expect the pen and people who are expecting a pen with k tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as Indian tablet market and its offerings but for k they could just offer a bundle where you pay kk rupees more and get the pen as an add on the accessory market might not be that vibrant already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at rupees LOL the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and i dont trust those type of casesone more issue that I would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has a tendency to creep up prices by rupees within a month or two by doing the good old GST BRO so if it ever reaches k for the gb version just close your eyes and buy an iPad with card discountsso in a nut shell for K it is was no brainer but even for K it is a really good deal considering what its competitors arehope this was helpfulI have been using the Mi Pad for over a month now and am only glad that I didnt spend more on an iPad Once the retailtherapy phase of the device wears off what remains is the user experience While it is true for both devices I find that Im more at ease with the Mi pad for the sheer look and feel of the content I watch in it I also spend a lot of time reading books and illustrated designs PDFs and I often found myself amazed almost chuffed over how good the content looked That display gets the accolades for a reasonThe Mi Pad largely meets my expectations and when people see this tablet the immediate comparison they make is how much it resembles the iPad a gross generalisation So heres my take on Apples iPad th Gen vs Xiaomi Pad If you have an Apple device already and are especially looking to expand on the productivity element from the tablet you need to stick to the iPad Not just because it is going to regulate the standard but you will definitely miss out on the features that ecosystem offersSo buy the iPad if youare not concerned about the pricetagare looking at designing with the Apple pencil and are familiar with or going to use ProCreateare making an investment with this purchase and will not be back in the market for a new tablet anytime soonintend to use the tablet for presentations and want to take no chances with the devicehave a clear purpose for the Sidecar feature if you dont use it despite buying the iPad you are missing outengage in a lot of official videoconferences and are prone to moving about and may accidentally go out of frame The iPad has a feature that addresses this to an extentare not expecting substantially higher results than the Mi Pad from the inbuilt camera in generalhave a proclivity towards the Apple design their decisions and are generally happy with the software choices Apple makes for youdont really care about features beyond a rigid list of activities you are certain the iPad is able to do and that this list is unlikely to change in the near futurelooking for a reliable product that will receive Software support for a long period of timeare expecting the device to be used by responsible adults who are careful with the tabletare unaffected by hefty repair costs should the glass crack or the rear panel be dentedhave a need to use touch IDOn the other hand buy the Mi pad if youare looking at gaming on a plethora of titles that are on the Google PlayStore and perhaps not found elsewheredont care much about the stock iOS cookiecutter experience and think customization is the only way youll truly be happy with the tablet you usewant the best quality of video and photo capture from a tablet meaning better video calls and video capture This doesnt mean the camera will replace the phone you already have but the Pad is a tool that goes the extramile of taking good quality images scanning documents and allows edits on its large screenvalue videoquality from the Mi Pad camera than the AI that drives the facetracking function iPad offerswant the most of the audio experience higher audio quality clarity and richnessare expecting rich colour depth HDR quality video experience and will be spending more than of your time on the tablet watching videosdont like limitations imposed on you as with the software you use sideload APKs rooting Custom Firmware overclocking etc If you do any or all of these forget about the iPadare mostly going to use it as a fun device to watch movies on or consume audiovisual mediaare not expecting to pay an arm and a leg comparatively to fix a broken screen or a damaged back panelare okay without a fingerprint scanner and is okay with FaceID PIN or Pattern for securityAt the end of the day you as a user of the tablet spend most of your time looking at the glorious screen of the tablet and interacting with what inside the device not the logo at the backThe tablet is totally fine but sometimes is bucked out there is so many bugs bugs glitches I have contact to Xiaomi they will try to fix it One req dont upgraded after you buy dont have to do After the update not a single Google application is running on floating window and while split screen there is so many Black patches around the bar white bar sometimes nice tablet you can go with it And if you are thinking about productivity multimedia go for it because most mostly as student do presentation word Excel taken notes and all the things and handle easily were by this tablet and I am using it for games and other purposes it handle it quite nicely but you have to wait for Android l because Android l is good for tabletNew update is hereSo the new Android update is here unfortunately is not Android l but is working fine all the bugs has been fixed few miner bugs are there but its totally refined from the past and system is working great hertzs now looks amazing because animation bugs has been fixed and battery life is been fixed is now working more than hours fortunately video playback and for day to day task you can go easily to days because I am doing PPT Excel sheet and other documentation its work totally fine and yeah thats the new update and go for xiaomi back About pencilSo I bought xiaomi pencil for and if I say latency has been improved but if if you dont have the budget of go for another shopping site which name after f cart yeah and you can buy its fsmart buy pencil for rupees it works fine too and you dont have to spend you can go with the just you will not have those key features like taking screenshots and write something on it or double tap to note downover all i am satisfied with this tablet,4.6,B09XXZXQC1,0,0,1,1,0,0,25,11,11,25,409.170.984.455.958

Product",Purchased from Amazon for full price under no offers still beat competitors by RsOrder was placed on Thursday late in the evening at pmWas to be Delivered on Thursday but arrived early on Monday at amQuite satisfied with the Delivery Packaging Condition of the item and also Happy with the early arrivalAlong with the Vacuum we received a basic Instruction Manual and Warranty CardThe Invoice was missing from the parcel so it had to be downloaded from AmazonTo Register your Warranty you require to scan the Bar Code on the Invoice and WhatsApp the detailsWithout any delay excitedly we got to assemble the unit which was a fairly easy task took approximately minutes which I guess is ok for the first time while getting familiar with all various attachments etcFirst impressions the Vacuum itself looks sturdy built wise but some attachments could be a little stronger Especially the extension pipes could be Stainless Steel same as the Drum and Telescopic in feature operation The main Vacuuming head attachment used for floor hard surfaces could also be Stainless Steel as it gets used the most and gets banged around quite a bit would extend its lifeIts a pin plug instead of a pin which could have been better with a surge protector fuseThe cord is of decent length quite impressed with the quality of the cord Also the cord which has no autowind and cannot be inserted within the body of the unit after use can be rested on top of the Drum in a winding fashion it kinda works and does keep in place without being a nuisance Hose same solutionThe side Latches are reasonably strong Wheels are easy to install insert and work fineIt would be absolutely fantastic if the various attachments could be stored latched to the main unit while not in use storage wise but can understand the limitations in this regardFirst demo was for the VacuumNoise average not too loud or unbearable reasonable with any other domestic Vacuum of similar powerInside the lid the dust bag clings on to its inlet would be better if it could be secured locked with a clipIn Vacuum suction mode the air gets forced out of the Blower outlet this outlet is directed on the opposite side of the unit and is directed straight onto the floor level Now imagine if you had not yet cleaned that part of the room and that dust gets thrown around or blown onto the already cleaned surfaces it would be an unending job like a dog chasing its tail If this outlet had a removable or having the ability to rotate something like a flap or adjustable Ac vents like in cars then it could direct the blown out air upwards while Vacuuming the surfaces and this could have been of great design senseSuction is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is importantThen follows the demo for the BlowerThis feature should technically be equally as strong as the Vacuum because the force of the air sucked in while Vacuuming is supposedly the same force leaving the Blower outlet To make things interesting there are fish gill like vents on either sides of the Lid These vents are the fixed kind cannot be closed or opened One of the vent very faintly can be felt takingin air while the other vent blows out air at a significant force This particular phenomena I am bewildered with cause as I understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the Blower outlet So make of it what you will Still does the job if youre looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours petFinally the demo for the WetPerformance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is important May need to dry mop even after using the Wet functionIn closingDefinitely do purchase it use it often as required and also helps keeping fitDo not allow dust to settle on your Vacuum BlowerAlso ordered extrai American Micronic Replacement Dust Bag for AMIVCDWDx AMIVCDWDxii RODAK MM Mattress and Upholstery Nozzle for Vacuum Cleaner Wet and Dry Cleaning EU ImportIt have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners I bought this for my mother inlaw She likes it for being easy to use Its simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes Extension pipes are little loose though Its easy to clean those cat hairs now And dont have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor because its Wet and dry vaccum cleaner Hope the customer care is a good one incase of any needs arise They send me already opened package but not used I think They could have send us a fresh unopened perfectly sealed package No complaints untill now I liked the reusable dust cover feature also its easy to connect it inside Easy to handle dont have too much weightIt would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with a switchThis is a domestic beast great suctionOnly thing that should had been ther is speed controlNoise level is high but with such suction is ok As long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again I am okRest how it will stay with time will be something to seeIt is very easy to clean as the suction power is great very powerful machine indeedI have been looking for a good vaccum cleaner for a long time now I recently came across this and read the reviews etc Some were good and some were bad But at the same time I couldnt find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners in this price segment so I finally bought itIt came in a big Amazon box well packed and secured Unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images Here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible Very Good quality steel and plastic build The suctionkpa is really really good even with the thick carpets etc The wheels are really good tooThey move effortlessly You get a lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and theyre good quality The blower function is really powerful The bag insidewhich collects the dust dirt is big and can be cleaned Washed easily The noise level isnt much Its okay Not loud The cord length is mtrs which is enough The overheating protection is Good All the Accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the baseCons The only thing that I think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes They are good and fit well but if its a carpet or some other mats youre cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again Overall a Product which fits all your needsWet and Dry Cleaning of course Better than any other Vaccum cleaners in under k price range Go for it Ps Ive tried some other Vaccum cleaners too which are in the k and above range but this is the all in one OP Vaccum CleanerGood suction with great built qualityGood durabilitygood suction power and quality productVacuum cleaner is very fine suction power is quite good drying power is also just OKnoise level is high as I expected Cost is high as compared to other brands Overall I rated it four star,4.2,B072NCN9M4,1,0,1,1,1,0,21,13,13,22,409.170.984.455.958
"First day impressions: A BEAST!,A decent all rounder.,All good but multiple pairing is awful,Good Product by BoAt,Good Product (but Not well-finished) at a Fair Price of 1599",As I browsed various multiple earphones in this range on a notsobusy workday break I came across this very featurepacked product It seemed interesting and had something called DIRAC Opteo in it ANC So I thought Id give it a shotFirstday impressions its blown me awayExhaustive list of impressions DIRAC OPTEO Balanced sound with punchy bass Yeah and not booming bass Its so great and Im quite surprised it sounds like something youd expect at a higher price point Soundstage As soon as the headphone is switched on it starts in battery saving mode Once you turn on DIRAC Opteo mode you can literally feel the space opening up All the instruments feel individual and sound separated Fireflies by Owl City sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you Its really great for the price Treble and Mids Clean and clear The bass doesnt overpower them and feels just right The vocals come out clearly and all the instruments dont interfere with it Drive home by Steven Wilson sounds great Bass Punchy and tight I love how it fizzles in Bonfire by Knife Party and how it reverberates in Turn Down for what by DJ Snake Breakin a Sweatby Skrillex Zedd sounded tight and I discovered how well produced it is Lovers of tight bass this is your product Volume It gets really loud So loud that I cant listen to it at the highest setting But if thats your thing then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting but the bass is still pretty clean and loud ANC ANC is present but wont drown everything out Its a great add on but if youre looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero then this wont do that If you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes this will do the trick Ambient Sound mode The opposite of ANC it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation Again you cant blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo but you can listen with lower volume near volume and hear things around you If the ambient sound also increased as I increased volume it would have been amazing Calling Did a couple of calls With nonoise the other person said I sounded great I took a couple of calls in a local grocery store was pretty loud and the other end had no issue hearing me Buttons The button placement is easy and I didnt feel any issue getting used to the controls The simple manual explains everything in mins so read once and youre good to go To note The sound is best in DIRAC Opteo mode Every time you turn it on you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on Id have loved having it on by default Also every time I turn it on it plays a second tune which could have been shorter Imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on Ugh Connectivity Once I connected it to my phone the first time it connects to my phone within seconds of turning the earphones on Battery It seems to last long Ive been using them for about hrs and its gone down about Cannot say anything more yet though When you take both the earphones out of your ears it doesnt auto pause like some of the competitors Annoyed that this was missed would have saved so much more battery if they did this Build quality I have a black version Its made with good quality plastic and didnt feel heavy around my neck It doesnt have metal anywhere and its quite simple I think it looks decent Exercise Need to test Will update laterIn summary an easy recommendation If you can overlook the small issues theres a great sounding featurepacked and long lasting device here at a great price would definetely recommendFirst I was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say its got a pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons bass is good vocals are much clearer in Crystal bionic mode ANC is working to a degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but dont except any more than that no issues with call enx is working upto its name battery is sufficient around hours if you mix up the modes Overall a decent all rounded neckband jack of all and king of noneAll other things such as sound quality battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly If I connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time It does not work many times If headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you wont be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop This is a big bug Please fix thisThis BoAt ANC Neckband is very Good but needs improvement and fixesPros Nice Sound Quality while using Crystal Bionic Sound but its average on normal mode which feels a little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points Great Build Quality Its ANC Ambience mode is good in this price range Its quite Comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting It has Dual Pairing which is very good but its not very seamless and there is a small issue with dual pairing eg while receiving a call on one device the audiovideo being played at another device wont Pause you have to manually pause instead there wont be any sound output through that device Its a little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving a call on another device as this is available on BoAt Rockerz and a few different BoAt NeckbandsCons Its range is very low considering Bluetooth v I even have BoAt neckband with v which has better range Even a single wall coming in between ms can block the sound output Its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly hours everyday with Bionic Crystal ModeANC enabled While using Dual Pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between And the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices This happened on the Replacement unit I received maybe its not the case with your unit Sometimes no sound is received while playing Audio from both devices I dont know if its wrong with my unit or every unitOverall this is a good and considerable Neckband under k if you want Good BassRich Sound Quality ANCAmbience mode and Descent battery lifeBut if your requirements mostly is Dual Pairing then this is not for you As I bought this considering Dual Pairing feature most importantly But its not really seamless in between Devices but still its the best possible available feature in this price range or even under k but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficientAnother problem with Dual Pairing is that the media doesnt gets paused on first device if theres a call on the second one which is already there on BoAts few other Neckbands but then there is no MediaPause feature on them eg If audio is being played on devices first device Audio will get paused if Audio is played on second device and viceversaSo do try it out by yourself Because its my personal experience with the Neckband maybe you get a better experienceThanks for Reading Happy ShoppingBought this one after using Rockerz pro for over years now Comparing this with that that one was ergonomically better felt snug in earsStandalone review of this Noise Cancellation is just alright not too great not too bad Sound Quality is definitely great and excellent with the Bionic Sound feature Kudos on that part Bass Quality is fairly good at this price point Holds charge for as long as advertised Overall bulky nature of the neckband puts you off and then the finish is poor too around the control buttons making it look very tacky cheap atleast on the funky grey one which I bought because it was priced lowestConclusionGood Product at a Fair Price ie Nothing too great but nothing bad

"Most featured UPS,Not Sufficient for a 65"" Sony 4K TV,Easy to install,Kind of useless for a PC with a GPU,How to return,Value for money,Big,Good stuff for it's purpose, it is working",My office PC UPS Legrand Numeric UPS Digital EXV is having only one LED and beep codes This is not sufficient if we want more details However the unit is robust easy to disassemble easy to replace battery with generic battery having best transfer time less than milli Sec min backup for CPU Monitor when checked In view of this the Legrand Numeric UPS Digital EXV should my the number one choice But it also has low user ratingsThe following brands came to my notice on search APC BXCIN APC BXCIIN Emerson Liebert iTon CX I have not considered microtek intex iball vguard etc may be they are goodThe technical parameters of the above all looked similar like generator compatibility AVR Highlowoverload protections But the transfer time specified for Numeric is less than milli sec for APC milli sec typical and for Liebert millisecondsAPC BXCIN is selected as my requirement is not for PC or laptop further search is not done for UPS with communication port and auto save software and in view of better interface Power LED Dual color Charging LED Dual colour Battery saver LED It also has better backup and surge power than APC BXCIIN minus resettable thermal relayBased on the reviews there are four major issues i have noticed very old stock Battery capacity expected to be in reduced condition resulting into low backup time or battery issue Transit damages as it is bulky to its volume Though it is better to purchase such items offline I still tried online in view of remote location No load protection It acts if very low load is connected eg just modem or less than w and battery saver mode is on after min people get confused it as giving only min backup it shouldnt be considered as a problem once known since additional loads can be connected or battery saver mode can be unselected If Battery saver is enabled it shutdowns while min juice still left it shouldnt be considered as a problem since it can be unselected if selected intentionally or unintentionallyTo reduce the above risks Ms Appario Retail Private Ltd was chosen at lightening deal at Rs Rs The order was placed on The product is delivered in days on The original packing was wrapped in repeated turns of polyethylene The packing reached without any major distortions The original cartoon packing was in sealed condition However when it was opened some parts looseness sound was coming from the UPS The same was reported to APC service center They registered the complaint and told me that the service person will visit within hours of working days Further they have given clearance to put the UPS in serviceFirst it was charged fully while UPS in off condition charging light was on while charging and it became off after charging Now the UPS was made on by power button it is to be pressed and hold for not less than second before release or release after beep tone connected to PC with inch LED TV initially some repeated chattering without any power interruption to the load was happening if power input is kept off on battery It was happening some timesWhen it is on battery beep sound was occurring every sec against APC Manual spec of secit withstood for minutes for the PC with inch LED TV on battery Battery save mode was in off conditionFurther it got switched off within sec of low battery alarm against sec specified in the manualThe manufacturing date as per slip glued on original packing was Nov photo attached but the test and quality passing date is hrs photo attachedAs my load is more than w I can put it on battery saver mode the battery saver button to be pressed and hold for not lessthan seconds before release to change the state this is minor but the holding time is no where written in the manualThe UPS body temperature appears to be on higher side when compared to Numeric installed at office under similar ambient temperature while on load with input mains as well as while in off condition without charging but connected to mainsThe above is initial experience only any updates shall be shared in futureNote This item isnt eligible for returnFor safety reasons items containing flammable liquids or gases cant be returned to Amazon For more information or help please contact themIf you want return facility search for other alternativesUpdate The service person called me on and informed about his planned visit on The service person visited in the morning of and disassembled the UPS there was a minor play with the battery the whole casing is of plastic one side cover opens including top as one part the play may be due to design manufacturing tolerances The PCB and the transformer were already firmly fastened to body and all connections were also tight Hence the looseness is acceptable The battery manufacturing date was Oct I agreed for his optional proposal to replace with a new sealed battery but manufactured in Sept The chattering may be relevant to building wiring as it is not happening with main sockets in other rooms or if we remove UPS input plug from the same socket see next update for accurate reason In the whole the service persons only concern was hotter transformer based on his experience but it will be replaced only if it failsPrompt response of service center is appreciable that too for an interior of km from service center located at state capital and it compliments the non return policyUpdate It is fully charged with replaced battery and backup time was tested with the same load as above But this time large improvements were observed in the backup time and parameters difficult to reason out as belowBackup time is Min until some different type of blinking of power led different type of beeps happens for few seconds may be relevant to battery saver mode and however it got normalized in auto after min further the battery low blinking of power LED occurred hence total min against min of earlier experience as above and these beeps occurred for seconds before it tripped against seconds of earlier experience as above but power LED was glowing for every few seconds till further seconds in off conditionBattery on beep was occurring for every seconds min to indicate the load is on battery against every second earlier experience as above I was totally involved with service person as it has to protect very costly bulky and distant service partner type equipment at my home He has replaced only battery and he has not even removed the PCB But how so many wonders have happened is yet to be analyzed and reasoned outNote I NonRMSMultimeter does not properly read the voltage of a UPS that uses stepped approximated output sine wave while on battery Hence output voltage of a VAC UPS is measured to be between VAC when on batteryIi Low voltage cut off will act if any separate low voltage high voltage cutoff protection is used at outlet of UPS while on batteryIii chattering may take place at UPS if any separate surge protection is used at UPS outletIv some body already advised not to use any surge protection at input to UPSV APC service person informed that APC UPS will not on if house is not properly grounded earthing is to be proper to protect from surgesVi if UPS is on battery with battery saver mode enabled ie mains off it will give only min backup to loads less than w as no load protection acts however if the load is more than w it shutdowns while min juice still left ie if we disable battery saver mode we will get min more backup powerFrom the above the UPS is now functioning as per specifications but one star of APC is reduced against initial issues of equipment though super fast response exists from their service center stars to Ms Appario Retail Private Ltd the seller stars to the APC service center and stars to courier Ms Delivery for safe and fast deliveryUpdate After months of use backup time testing ignoring erroneous tests in betweenThe ups was made on and battery saver was made off due to this the ups started self charging further and I have waited till the charging is completed Now the TV as monitor with PC were made on it took upto amp during cold boot amp measured with clamp meter while mains is on once the PC stabilised A the mains is switched off Now it gavea backup of minutes with beep every minute and given repeated beeps at th min Again every min one beep started for min After this repeated beeps occurred for second and ups got tripped Hence I got minutes and seconds in total In view of this the star rating is retained at starOne more observation is that its transformer temperature is high while it is on battery that means more energy is being wasted by transformerI got the battery replaced one more time on under warranty as backup time reduced to min under the same conditions and load With new battery I am getting minutes Hence the Apc is being letdown by battery manufacturer where Apc quality person should have control After warranty I will install battery from exide and seeProsThe device is sleek small and blends into the environmentConsMakes a lot of noiseI bought this primarily to support my television Sony XRXK to handle the switch from generators to mains For Secs It is not sufficient to do that and the TV switches on and off continuously when running on UPS power Im not sure what the problem is as the wattage is sufficientIf you have a similar use case as mine better consult a local inverter shop and get a UPS that fits your requirement Else you will end up with dead weightEasy to installMy PC has a W PSU with Bronze effeciency but installed components are not supposed to go beyond watts under max load This UPS shuts down as soon as my GPU GTX reaches Then I used it for my printer But as soon as I hit print the UPS shuts down So its useless there as wellNow its attached to my TV router and speakers Atleast I can watch Netflix uninterruptedIm getting trouble in this I think this is not working properly where should I returnValue for money so far working goodSmall but big life of

"How to choose an iron ? This one-A decent combo of features & price.Cable quality not good though.,Quality Iron for power users with effective spray & steam function | Review | Guide | Tips,Doesn’t remove hard wrinkles.,Easyto use but it leaks water,Very easy to use,Good product,Quick warm up,Not good",Update as on The power cord has developed twists beyond repair and the seperate cores are now visiblethe insulation pvc of the cores doesnt look very durableI dont know why such standard manufacturers cant provide a decent durable cableThe iron however is performing flawlesslyStill disappointed as in coming weeks ill have to change the cable for sureReducing one star for compromising upon the cable quality by such a big brand nameHOW IT STARTED THE NEED FOR AN IRONxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxRecently my previous Bajaj make dry iron which I received as a gift from somewhere started giving problems after two years of occasional use with not so careful handling and care Initially Its wires insulation inside was found rotten around the iron entry point which I repaired myself and later its thermostat started giving problems Finally its ON indication went OFF and I decided that it was time to bid goodbye to it and find a new oneHence my search for a reputed brand make best value for money device began Being from Electrical Engineering background occupation I fairly summed up my expectations from the power device as below DRY IRON VS STEAM IRON xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis was fairly simple if we consider the explanation that a steam iron could perform as a dry iron but viceversa was not possible Also almost always you find some or the other stubborn wrinkles and crease distortions that is hard for the dry iron to overcome and you need to use water for the purposeOn the contrary As the steam loosens the individual fibres of the clothes the steam irons pressing action smooths out wrinklesHence it was better to be equipped with the facility in the first place in the device itself BRAND REPUTATION WARRANTYxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAs an average consumer We are not wrong in generally assuming that products of bigger established brands have a higher quality and perform better Rightfully so A brand which has been working with a product for decades has a plenty of experience research regarding the possible points of failures of the product and can be surely trusted uponFollowing the same footprints I thought not to take bets upon power devices like iron and go with the Super brands like Philips having decades of expertise in this fieldOur product comes with a two year global warranty which is quite decent in my opinion STEAM OUTPUT STEAM BURST VERTICAL STEAM FEATURExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxDuring normal usage with steam a delivery of anything above gramsmin is okay but Some ironing jobs such as curtains or quilts require a much more supply of steam In such cases the steam burst feature comes in handy Users can push a button to receive a burst of steam when needed More holes in the sole plate add to the effectiveness of steam suppliedVertical steam feature in theory can direct clouds of steam in and around vertically hung garments or curtains which eliminates wrinkles without the need for a pressing forceHowever in practical scenario and by virtue of its design and water tank limitations a steam iron is virtually incapable of addressing the wrinkles like that and hence paying more for such a feature is not advisedUse dedicated garment steamers for that purpose Our Philips GC comes with a variable setting for steam output with a continuous delivery of up to gramsmin which is quite goodAdditionally It can provide steam burst too for stubborn wrinkles Vertical steam feature is not available though ELECTRICAL RELATED FEATURES WATTAGE CORDTHERMOSTAT etcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe simple maths that more watts means more heat or more steam or quick heating is not as simple as it looks Surely more watts means more heat generated but more wattage limits our ability to plug the iron at any socket in the house as for any power above Watts I would suggest to only plugin to the power socketsGoing for more power demands must be backed up with careful examination as to whether you really need that much heating if its normal clothes only that you need to iron most of the times Surely More heat developed is capable to deliver more steam but that depends upon the number of holes in your sole plate for it to be really effective Your water holding tank size and lastly steam delivery settingsGenerating too much steam without delivery can be dangerous as it can pressurize the system Last but not the least More power doesnt always mean quick heating as heating of the sole plate depends upon a number of factors like the material thickness of the sole plate Surface area of the heating element used inside the soleplate etcMost of these intricate details are variable in nature and cannot be specifically mentioned by the manufacturer OUR PRODUCT Comes with a decent Watts of power good enough for routine casual use along with occasional use on heavier fabrics Comes with a Volts Amp Max rating of plug is always extra to actual amperage pin Top which can be easily plugged into our casual amp sockets as well without any damage to the socketHence enhanced mobility performance The cord length is around meters which is good enough for any practical lengthsAny more than that would be cumbersome to handle The cord is braided with an insulated cotton sleeve which is useful for twists as well as insulating during a cable damageHowever in due course of use the cord often develops rigid twists turns beneath the cotton braiding which is hard to straighten outSo not so great on the cable quality terms The cable only comes with degrees of swivel movement which is quite disappointing and I would have really wished if it was degrees of cord freedom The thermostat knob for temperature selection comes with regular settings but going with a reputed brand like Philips always assures of a good quality of thermostatAfter all the thermostat is the heart and soul of modern day irons and must be highly durable and reliable Lastly our product is an ISI marked product which is quite an assurance for sure SOLEPLATE MATERIAL SHAPExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis is probably the toughest part where each company claims to have the best and easy gliding soleplatesA variety of soleplates are available in the market today like nonstick Teflon coated aluminium plates with American heritage coating Steel plates with alloys or Ceramic coatedEach has its pros and cons Teflon coated plates are easy to get scratched and gather dirt over a period of time American Heritage is similar to Teflon and glides over the fabric even better Stainless steel is the most durable and easy to clean however may stick to clothes on higher settingsAdds weight to the device Metal works better than ceramic for pressing in sharp creases on sleeves and trousers Good for smooth gliding and even heat distribution but biggest advantage is to eliminate static charge at high temperatures which may cause clothes to stickWhen ironing on synthetics and fabrics blended with spandex a ceramic iron will suit your needs best as ceramic does not stick to these fabrics but the coating may peel off on rough handling Aluminium soleplates heat up quickly but are prone to damage and may stick to clothes Our Product comes with a linished soleplate which is quite inadequate detail as linishing is a process of grinding or polishing a surface to make it a perfect flat However apart from linishing stuff I can surely say that the soleplate in our device is decent gliding but not the best gliding Its heavy but doesnt stick to the clothes yetFor that matter I trusted the brand reputation and went ahead with this linished soleplate Stay away from Teflon coated ones though as its bound to wear off fastRegarding the shape I honestly wanted it to look like American fighter planes with sharp beak design and dark colorsLOLHowever those models with my looks were weak in overall specs so had to settle down with this StillDecent Looking model FEATURES LIKE ANTI DRIP ANTICALC GRIPxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxTo tell you the truth these are more of a fancy terms rather than actual purpose for most of the users Presence of these features isnt a problem though as in areas where the water comes hard Anticalc may stir and clear the calcium build up if any in the water tankHowever If you use proper water drain it out timely Do not fully fill the tank allow it to heat before using steam follow all procedures correctly you wont actually need to use these featuresRegarding Grip Many iron nowadays have some unique design which is set ergonomically to give a better grip Our product comes with the anticalc function and is decent to grip though I think not ergonomically still nothing for a deal breaker and these are minor features to discuss upon PRICE VS PERFORMANCExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxEven though I did not have any preset price tag in my mind but still going over would have definitely felt extreme for a thing that I dont make use of that much I bought it at a price of around bucks for all the features and performance it delivers I think it is worth itFINAL VERDICTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all I would just say that even though our product might not have the best appealing looks or the best soleplate or the best burst of steam or the best swivel of the cord still what it has is a complete package of all the individual features clubbed together in a decent rightperforming way which is hard to come by in an individual modelI got this one ondemand from mother For a few days she was insisting on buying one iron for daily chores I was already researching iron for one of my friends So this search did not last long DEven earlier Philips was the only name that came to my mind due to its consistency product quality I

function is well designed it evenly sprays water and not just throws a fine jet of water The spray function produces a fine mist that evenly moistens the fabric making it easier to iron out tough creases Wattage w is sufficient enough for home usage and can easily cover tough wrinkles and heavy clothes Easy and fast filling of the tank owing to the huge filling hole Easy and complete emptying of the water tank owing to the large hole and the sideways opening door Weight on the ok side not a lightweight but not even heavyweight Some weight is useful as it helps ironing by applying pressure on the cloth Empty iron is lightweight onlyCONS Steam control knob looks loose at first but it works well in the long run Water movement during iron creates jerks and affects smooth operation But thats the way it will work you cant do anything For regular lightweight iron users it will appear bulky at first But you get used to it in a few days No steam burst function in this model GC but you get what you pay for Cons are temporary and dont affect functionality in the long run So a deviceBUTTONS KNOBSSpray Button push to spraySteam Knob Off no steam Low less steam High high steam Calc clean mode calcium deposit cleaning more belowTemperature Dial Rotate to set temperature cutoff for different fabric types Linen Cotton Woolen Silk etcUSAGE GUIDE Keep knob dial in off position Fill the tank to the max level if planning to use steam function Connect to mains Set the temperature control knob to the required position Let it warm up until the indicator goes off Now operate steam knob to low or high steam Enjoy ironing or steaming without interruption till water lasts Use water spray function as requiredUSAGE TIPS Use RO filtered water if possible as its low in hardness and will ensure the longevity of iron without choking the vents or orifices let the iron heat properly before use Leakage has been observed if one uses the Iron without heating properly as water will directly pass from vents without getting converted to steam Gently clean soleplate and dont use any hard material or chemicals Emptying water tank every time after usage is recommended to avoid scaling problem As calcium deposits are more in standing water Untangle straighten the cord once after every use before storage As these cords tend to develop sharp irrecoverable turns over time and those are hot zones for cable failure When not using steam function keep the steam knob in off position Use calc clean mode once in weeks if using normal tap water with medium hardness If water is very hard increase the frequency or if using RO water decrease frequency Once in a few months clean steam control needle using vinegar To remove the needle rotate the knob to calc clean mode and gently pull it out Last but most important use a properly earthed wall socket for iron to avoid shocksCALC CLEANING MODEThis iron has a calc cleaning mode to descale it To do so follow the steps below Keep knob in the steam off position Fill tank to max level Rotate temperature dial to max position and wait for the indicator to go off Take out socket from mains and move iron to sink Turn the steam knob to calc clean position and pull it up a few cms Let all water be used up Steam and hot water come out along with calcium deposits The principle behind this function is a sudden change in temperatures of inside zone which leads to contraction expansion resulting in scaling shredding and flush outCLARIFICATION DAMAGE TO BODY OR PLATE OTHER ISSUES concerns raised by other usersSeveral users posted about the damaged product or soleplate on arrival and other usage issues Let me put my insights into those I had no issue with the quality of the product delivered It arrived in proper condition without any damage anywhere as proper care was taken for this using air cushions Maybe their seller was careless enough and that resulted in damage during transit Soleplate had no marks on it Yes here Philips can provide a protective sticker or film on the plate which will reduce the ratio of complaints for the damaged sole plate on arrival Temperature dial works properly and markings are intact after months of usage Slight difference in color tone maybe there across different zones as different materials are used as per requirement Say hot zone near plate vs cold zone at back Leakage will be there if the steam knob is in steam position and iron is not sufficiently hot to convert incoming water So its passed directly appears as leakage Philips has explicitly mentioned this in product details Remember to order it from a reputed seller Check seller ratings reviews and amazon verified tag to avoid any issues like the faulty product duplicate product etcDONT GET CONFUSED Theres No Steam Burst Mode Here Some of the photos displayed are with steam burst function symbol on the button even some users have mentioned this in their reviews but it is not present in this model Models with the said function have two buttons for spray burst instead of one here for spray only Also steam output at one place is gmin another place gmin Its actually gminFINAL VERDICT If you are looking for good quality durable steaming iron in the k range Philips is the name you should seek for This model of Philips has got good build quality features which are more than enough for an average home user So at any point you can go for this model If on a lower budget k range you can go for Philips GC w or Bajaj MX w but both are low power and Philips one misses steam spray function too But still both will cover most of the usage pattern of a home user Heavy users may go for Philips EasySpeed Plus GC w or BlackDecker BD BXIRIN w or Morphy Richards Super Glide w in k rangeNOTE Unlike regular lightweight irons steam irons generally dont go easy with repairs Unlike regular iron If the coil is damaged in the steam iron whole of the bottom plate needs to be replaced if you are out of warranty it will cost you a lot In fact for the cost of the plate plus a few bucks you get a new iron So check your requirement for regular vs steam iron choose wiselyI tried removing hard wrinkles of a jeans but it couldnt remove them properly They were still visible even after using the steamEasyto use but it leaks waterVery goodIts a good productIron is good and the best delivery with few hours just this iron doesnt have a stream burstrest is goodSimple cloth iron,4.3,B008QTK47Q,1,0,1,1,3,0,43,17,17,46,409.170.984.455.958
"Excellent Phone in the budget segment,Best value for money... But afraid of future MIUI updates.,Don't purchase it as camera phone 😤,Dependable & it's been a year.,Budget mobile,Good for basic use,Phone is nice , but software is not",I was looking for a phone below K I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones My requirement was a phone that has good network reception good wifi reception a balanced software good battery life good screen that dont strain eyes a good hardware mm headphone jack and a charger i dont need G network because G drains battery a lot and G spends too much data I dont watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD K K videos over mobile network For downloading documents social networks banking apps G is more than enoughIn my budget I found all phones have gb RAM Realme Narzo was during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note with gb RAM at gb RAM is always preferred over gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away So this was the only option I knew then availableRedmi note has AMOLED Display I am not bothered with Hz HzHz I keep the refresh rate at Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter All my Desktop screen has Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a Hz screen I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you dont need that Display size is inch it could have been better if it were inch I prefer big display phone Redmi note has that big display A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth The screen has a punch hole camera which looks goodThis phone duel speakers One is more powerful at bottom and another on top But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good What more do you expect from such tiny speakersThe phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor still I get good signal and never disconnected Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phoneThe phone has mAh battery and comes with W charger which is a bonus at this price point The battery gives long backup With good mobile network you can use it for days without charging using basic features like phone sms email FB WA etc But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below The phone has SD processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag The experience is butter smooth However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I dont have to clear RAM manually However after Android update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared SD doesnt heat up and it is very energy efficient Because of that battery drains very little and W charger charges phone within mins for my usage The cable is USB A to C and feels goodThis phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailableThis phone has DDRX RAM and UFS storage The RAM is GB and can be expanded additional GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life This has Sim SD card slot Which is a great Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregationThe phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones And I have no problem with plastic I dont think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap I am happy with plastic back The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month This is inherent chemistry of TPU and no one can prevent this chemical degradation How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlightThe fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly The touch screen is excellent tooHowever I dont like some of the preinstalled apps Some can be uninstalled a few cant especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store I dont like them However I like the pre installed security app There is no ad in notification and all can be easily disabled Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good Does not show pictures like MP camera I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note back camera MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the userSo I give Redmi a score of This is an excellent phone the I got at during Great Indian festival I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone This phone is not for gamers or people who watch K k videos or shoot such things This is not or those who are crazy for G Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment days usage Good battery LIFE Bqest for dayday use W charger also good Best display but shouldve hz instead of Sturdy inhand feel Stereo speaker is loud and crisp split Camera above average But good concerning the price Buggy UIminor as expected But ui all way better than bloody MIUI G chipset SD which is fine G always available Some minor issue with WiFi reception Dont know may be they will fix it through OTA THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE THERE CASUAL GAMER BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWSMOVIES NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMINGNOT FOR PUBG COD LOVERSThe first look of this starbust design is eye catchyno word to express its designin hand feel and and its all physical dimension the second this which impress me its battery backupeven you playing game hardly for a long timeit gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also W is also a good deal at this price The third impressive factor is its dual speakerI have an another phone of k and the sound quality is almost same as it Media playback experience is also enhanced by its amoled display very colour charming display literally the display quality is unbeatable The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point Fingerprint button is also very responsive All other things and features are good to the price pointOnly one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower gradeeven my old Redmi Y which I exchanged with this had better camera than this So plz I request you to all dont buy this for camerajust dont The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to meI dont recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phoneIf you are non camera user then you will surely go for itPros design inhand feel battery and charging amoled displaydual speakerCons cameraQuite a smooth daily driver phone The overall experience has been satisfactory cameras good durability also seems to be good Ive dropped it quite a few times the gorilla glass seems to be holding up hz feels great Charging speed is good too nothing mindblowing though Battery life is decent Lasts quite a bit but since I keep it in the hz mode all the time its a little less for me But I dont have any problem with battery life for nowIt does what the description saysCamera quality not upto the mark compared to other redmi mobiles Even A model clicks better picsFinger print sensor is same as that of the lock button You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint readVolume is good for both call and streamingFast charging but charger gets heated soonBattery back up is good unless you dont do heavy gaming and all day video sreamingDual app and dual space option is missingLight weight and good video resolutionOverall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography gamingI bought this for my dad and its working good for him if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone userPhone is good but i facing weird bugs due to software issues After that i manually installed latest global software then working fineWhen i was using indian firmware after the update the phone got into bootloop every sec but after manual installation its working fine,4.1,B09QS9X16F,1,0,1,1,2,0,13,14,14,15,409.170.984.455.958
"DETAILED REVIEW after 3 WEEKS of Usage !!!,Priceworthy.,It's a good product,Good,Vivid picture quality is stunning,SUPER DEAL,Value for money,Very nice",NOTE If you select brandauthorized TV installation then DO NOT unbox the tv until MI representative arrivesThis ensures that if TV is damaged in transportation then you will get replacement easily If you didnt choose installation then just SHOOT the video of unboxing by yourself to avoid any hassle in case replacement is needed Amazon Prime and Netflix are not inbuilt but can be Sideloaded To use your Set top box with android interface you need to buy MI IR cable and set it up OR else directly connect the set up box via AV or HDMI port to use it conventionally Out of GB memory you only get around GB free to use check the image attachedThere are Hundreds of review on this TV here as well as on youtube but NONE explains the TVs potential completely and what its actual flaws are Heres a quick Fact for the Users complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv then it would alone cost you more than K rupees here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under K So just check once what options you have before complainingEventually I bought this TV since I was already using A version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom Now after using this TV for over weeks I am stating my DETAILED user experience Its a detailed huge review but do read it if you want to invest this much amount If you want to get quick overview of the device then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review Firstly its budget friendly ONLY Smart TV under k in the current market Has Most number of Output port AV HDMI USB Has Android out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth Has Dual interface MI Patchwall Android TV I mostly prefer android TV interface Remote has Bluetooth Voice Search with sleek profile Has better processor compared to predecessor along with GB RAM GB storage GB actual Speaker Output is low Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface Amazon prime Netflix is NOT preloaded but can be side loaded Native Display is ONLY HD though p even K videos from youtube works well check images attached Can install play tons of High quality games like RR etc check images attached Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the timeFULL DETAILED REVIEW BUILT QUALITY Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body Its not great but above average Table top stands looks bit flimsy but are workable The screws which are provided in the box DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly so I bought new from local store It has averagely slim profile not the slimmest in the market Speaker Placement is inconvenient Since they are placed at the bottom so when you keep it on table top the sound tends to dampen and bulge Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up Overall built quality is above averageDISPLAY QUALITY It has very Thin bezels which looks great Video resolution is xp but p videos works fine on it K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well Viewing angle are good compared to price Check the images attached Contrast is above average Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid Display quality is also above average not very greatREMOTE CONTROL Its very sleek and compact Has only buttons and is easy to operate Fortunately it has Volume buttons which is handy I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume P Placement of Voice search button is improper Its just below Power button and I end up pressing power button a lot Finally its bluetooth so no need to point it towards tv for operationOTHER FEATURES It has Dual interface ie Patchwall and android TV Has tons of content Many games can be installed till you have memory left including multiplayer games Google voice search is very useful if you dont want to use keyboard Processing speed is fast and I havent detected any lags yet Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed not due to hardware Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectlyCONS Speaker output though rated W is NOT upto the mark My W JBL speakers has better and louder sound Placement of speaker is inconvenient as in table top position speakers face the table and sound dampens Internal Memory is very LESS NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded though you can side load them Miracast not supported Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes Native resolution is just p HD though the p videos works on usb K on youtube Screen is Slightly reflective its similar to almost all the other LED tvs Mixed experiences of after sales serviceCUSTOMER CARE Firstly the installation is a Joke My installation was scheduled days after my product Delivery and the fun part is theres ONLY days replacement window for this product P Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative so theres NO point of return window time frame MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpfulVERDICT Considering all the facts if you are fine with above average Display quality want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget then this the TV you should certainly go for Trust me you wont get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months If you have higher budget then certainly explore brands like sony samsung etcThis is NOT a perfect smart TV but for the given price and Years of warranty its NO brainer to choose this its certainly worth the investmentThis television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of Performance The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play K bit HEVC videos right out of the box VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media supportPicture Quality Many people complain about the overbright screen But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settingsThese are my preferred settingsBacklight to During night even the lowest value of is bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyesDuring day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions A maximum of would be enoughSetting backlight to minimum improves black levels reduces power consumption increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during nightBrightness Brightness setting controls black levelIncreasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrastBrightness at pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationAt black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of detailsContrast to Contrast setting controls white levelContrast can be set anywhere between and Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed As the screen itself is very bright increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrastSaturation to Color saturation can be set anywhere between to At colors look more natural At colors looks a bit punchy But still its a personal preferenceAt the above settings the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at p The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TVLG K OLED Beauty Of Black DemoLG OLED Eclipse DemoLG HD Demo Art NouveauFull HD and K videos looks sharp in this TV Downloaded a sample K HEVC video named Life Untouched and also a K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good detailsScreen Quality I think this is a VA panel the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels The screen is glossy and hence reflective This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing itLike all other LCD panels this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but thats only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds While watching movies or other content its not at all a problem Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etcLuckily theres no backlight bleeding in the unit I receivedViewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but thats a common VA panel characteristic IPS panels with good viewing angles cant be expected at this price pointAll LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels VA panels excels in black depth despite its average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levelsSound Quality Bass is a bit weak I think bass is improved following some updates So giving stars from Its very loud even at low volume Midrange and treble are very good Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearlyEditIn a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good But it isntHz Hz Hz Hz Hz A high value of for Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffledThe following settings sounds much better and heres the reason Hz BassFrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick DrumToms Snare etc Hz Low MidrangeEnhances bass and depth of male vocals Increasing Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds Hz MidrangeImparts a metallic tone Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant Hz Upper MidrangeVocals especially female sounds best at this frequency A value of enhances vocal quality Increasing too much makes vocals harsh Hz TrebleAdds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments Enhances tinkling sounds of metallic instrumentsHuman ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here its and Hz Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue Even increasing Hz is disturbingGreat sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget But considering its midrange frequency clear treble and loudness it deserves starsRemote Control Minimalism is great But minimalism with less functionality is not so great Addition ofMuteTV Settings and Video input selection buttons would ve made the remote more functionalApp support UpdateWhen the TV was released there was no support for Netflix and Amazon Prime But now with Pie update it supports both Netflix and Amazon Prime Now the TV deserves stars for app supportPros and Cons Pros Powerful processor for K media playback App installation via USB Built in Chromecast Bluetooth remote Voice CommandCons UpdatePreviously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby optionBut in the latest update both these issues are solvedNow when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input sourceTo enable it go to Settngs Inputs Enable Stay on the previous source optionScreen off feature is also added in the new update Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off optionThe only disadvantage left on the TV was lack of Miracast But on a latest update build PI miracast is included and now its perfectTo sum upOverall considering the picture quality powerful hardware and the price the TV definitely deserve stars devoid of its average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across IndiaNew brands like iFFalcon Blaupunkt Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price But when it comes to service centres its a dead endI am very much satisfied with the purchaseIts good productGoodif you like a best tv on your budget Ill recommend you this stunning picture quality and DTS surround is osm but there was a few lagging problem and Miracast is not good Build quality goodsound and bass excellentProduct is very good Sound quality is crisp Worth buying I brought it years back Still working fineGood

"WORTH BUY ! THE BEST,Good for the price.",Its been days since i using the device extensivelyI bought it on the Last freedom sale for Rs including k instant discount couponFirst let me be clear I bought S FE G with Snapdragon not S FE with Exynos and i am a user who uses phone most of the time This review may be long but its worth to read it if youre buying this productLet me divide between the Pros and ConsFirst i would like like to start with Pros of the Device Pros Display Samsung has been already popular for its AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here They might have got some defective Piece I have no issues with my display Its been long time i saw a great display like this with Hz it is Super SmoothAlso it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions PS No tint issues The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didnt faced any issues with it Stereo Speakers As an extensive multimedia user this is one of the most favorable feature for meBelieve me you cant find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment its almost like flagship devices Both the speakers are adequately loud Battery As a person whos shifting from a normal Hz Device phone i was very worried about the battery life of this device at Hz but it surprised me very well Initially i thought i would need to switch to Hz for better battery life for daily usageBut I didnt even thought this device would give this much great battery life at HzAt Hz I am getting around hours of minimum SOT Screen on Time The maximum SOT i got at Hz is Hours minutesI didnt checked battery life at Hz because i didnt use it at Hz even a single day The battery life is Excellent Rear Cameras I am not a very good photographer or something i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionallyI was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very wellAdded Some Camera Samples above Pic Ultrawide Pic Telephoto Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading Both the three Cameras Primary Ultrawide Telephoto performs very wellIf youre a camera guy you should definitely check this out Performance RAM Management Im not a gamer I use my device for daily usage of social media ott platforms Calls messages etc but i use it extremelyI didnt faced any kind of heating issues with the device until nowAlso Ram management of the Device is excellent I am a person who uses appsbackground at single time and i didnt have any issues of closing down the apps ONE UI I was a stock Android guy but One UI actually surprised me it is very well optimised and very userfriendly for single hand usageinitial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but Im now got used to itPS I didnt found any kind of ads on my device as i didnt sign up or used any samsung Apps Build Quality Even though its back is made up of plastic the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device Future Proof The device has G Bands IP Rating Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracketIP Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices Its good to see samsung brings it at lower priceThis is the best future proof device as of nowSo these are the Major pros i noticed as of now Now lets move to the ConsCons NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX As an extensive multimedia user i found it very frustrating even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix Samsungs Flagship Killer doesnt have HDR supportIT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE No GB Variant This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim i found it little difficultBut if youre a single sim user luckily it have hybrid solution so you can use a Sim card expandable memory card Gorilla Glass Other competitors are providing atleast GG in this price range But S FE G has just GG Which also Im not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere But at the end of the day GLASS IS GLASS IT WILL BROKE No headphone Jack It is not any kind of unusual thing most of the phones above K segment doesnt have headphone jackSo we have to buy mm to Type C adapter type c earphones or bluetooth solutions Note Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support No W charger It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage but it may be a con for you Although the device supports W charging Only W charger is provided inside the box They should have given W inside the boxI didnt have any issues with W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speedFor the reference of Charging speed Both W W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using W you can get about within minutes where as with W chargerFull charge time i usually takes is hour and minutes Front Camera I am not a selfie guy but if youre a person whos looking for a selfie device just dont buy it its not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but its not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeCONCLUSION If youre a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life great rear cameras great performance better software support better build quality and use it for more than years the cons mentioned above doesnt bother youJust buy it I am sure you wont be disappointedIts been about days since I got this phone I got it for on prime day sale For the price its goodPros Camera Coming from Poco X the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price It gives you good colours contrast focus and everything that you want It has OIS which is very apparent while recording At k the stability is worse But set it to p and the videos will be amazingly stable And the main advantage of OIS other than stable video is GREAT night mode shots Hold the phone stable for a while and along with OIS you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure Attached samples Display Absolutely best Samsung displays are the best hz FHD Flows smoothly Colors and calibration is top notch Brightness is good but I felt its a little insufficient under direct sunlight Its visible but could be better OneUI The main reason for upgrading to this phone was software OneUI is the absolute best android skin right now It has way too many customisations in it and lets you personalise your phone to a very high degree Like theres a feature to read out the name of the person whos calling if your wearing headphones It took me days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs Also Knoxx security is a special mention Knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe Even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data Secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage And many more such good features While being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin it still feels very very smooth and fast to use Unlike MIUI or other skins it doesnt stutter much and bugs are lessThere are many other small pros like good stereo speakers Nice premium build quality Good data and wifi speeds Other such features that you wont notice but definitely make a difference in your experienceCons Software I know I said its a pro but I say this in the aspect of updates This phone was launched in March in India and samsung promises year android version updates and additional year of security updates But theres a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive Android It will receive A for sure Theres a lot of debate on what they will do with because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada Basically the phones life maybe to years if they give a But to if not I researched on the Internet a few people say that it will receive a while I was few say its not Its hard to say whos correct So assume its not getting a if you are going for it Battery The battery on this phone is mah and its good enough for a days use But thats because I use it lightly Not much online streaming No gaming light social media and other usual stuff If you use it even a tad bit more heavily you will run out within a day If youre going outside for the better part of a daylike a day trip to somewhere nearbyits better keep a power bank handy In terms of Screen on time numbers I once got hours of sot on light usage hr YouTube and hr streaming I was at home and used wifi all the timeI got hrs sot when I went outside for a day trip I took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before I could reach home On a mixed use day you can get to hours of sotFinal verdict The life of the phone in terms of Software Support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software So if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe years for other models But if you planning on using it for longer than years better avoid it In the upcoming diwali and dussera sales the price might

"Heavy duty mixer grinder, delivers what it promises,Works fast,It's not working good I had bought in 2020 and the motor is making,Good machine but cap locks can be much better,Good 👍,Great Mixer Grinder but not good for juices,Powerfull mixer grinder,Powerful but Pricey",Bosch TrueMixx Pro Mixer Grinder WattMGMMIN BlackReviewI usually do not write reviews but I felt I had to write this one because when I was researching which mixer to buy I found really bad reviews that do not do justice to the product I went with the trust on Bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product I have been using it daily sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period I hope this will help othersMixer includes capacity Mixer body Plastic blender jar ml fruit filter Wet grinding jar ml Dry grinding jar ml Chutney grinding jar ml extra Pounding Blade SpatulaBuild and overall appearance The mixergrinder watt motor is extremely powerfulI have used it to grind both dry wet ingredients such asgaram masala idlidosa mix Chana dal paste Poppy seeds pastecoconut chutney dry rice and urad dal powder ginger garlic paste ice etcI regularly blend and make milk shakes lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient Does the job fast within few secondsminutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with Body is good looking sturdy well balanced and easy to wipe clean The vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience Overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake The jars also are easy to use and quite wellbuiltJars Blades The jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades Chutney jar blade is fixed An extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect A spatula cum blade changer is provided The Jar lids are made of transparent plastic Each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquidsmaterials while grindingblending Each lid has rubber gaskets This gives a completely leak proof experience while grindingblending These gaskets are very easy to remove and attach All Jars have fibre clasps to close the jars In the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided this is the only thing I have not used hence I cannot review the performance of this attachment Blender can be used without the juicer sieve and works fine In wet blender a flowbreaker is providedSoundSound is high but that is to be expected in a powerful watt machineDos DontI feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product Do not overload Do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest When turning the speed knobs dont turn all at once from to max You will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly staying at each speed for a few seconds Actually for most things low to medium speed is enough The machine is really powerful When grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up not the machine so give a little rest in between For wet grinding use cold water to grind that way the jar will never heat up DO NOT grind hot ingredients Many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground Bring food to room temp and then grind Wash the jar gasket jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact Always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets In the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it To remove fine particles when dry grinding dont use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar You can use your hand and a brush used for this purpose only This is an expensive piece of equipment In my house only I my husband use it We do not allow children or household helpcooks to use it This way the machine will not be misused If you mixer does not work please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine Remove some of the ingredients and try again Take care while handling jar lids and lid tops Although they appear quite well made I cannot say if they will break when droppedPros The machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises It is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience Easy to clean Grinds and blends everything Leakproof lids Takes very little time to grind The motor does not heat up even easily The overload protector works perfectlyCons Guarantee Manual The Manual has to be downloaded from the Amazon websiteThe Amazon payment is the guarantee There is no separate guarantee card provided I had to call Amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card Delivery The mixergrinder came in a box but there was no special Styrofoam padding This was a big minus for me A couple of extra lid clasps should be provided one of my lid clasps was loose it is working fine at the moment but as a backup company should provide these As the jars are pretty large for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult I wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry wet grinding rather than only wet The jars do have screws heads on the inner side but this is not a big deal and can be cleaned quite easilyReview after using for few monthsPros The lock feature is really good for hands free usage Grinds very fast Say half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than minutes Juicer is good extraction is good for the juicy fruits Good design and takes less space in kitchenCons Noise is there for the power it grinds But anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which I read before my purchaseSteel jars get heated up quickly So I used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heatJust need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt a littlewet grinding jarTips clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge So that jars wont loose its shine I bought this Bosch mixer on and the motor is not working I have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such a big amount in itit worked only for yearsit was only for household purpose i purchasedvery much disappointed with a brandShowed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside True to its name the Bosch Mixer Grinder is a great machine to have in your kitchen However the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is a challengeNAThis is a very good product overall The dosaidli and other such batters come out excellent The motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needsThe only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer It works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus oranges watermelon etc But the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with a lower water content the juicer fails at extracting anything The juicer is basically another blender jar with a mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp There is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush themAll in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juicesI was a happy customer of Sujata for the past years and Bosch was a a good optionGood design powerfull motor worth for the price i bought in offer It has a powerful motor does grinding pretty fast Compact size Lid lock clip very useful Priced high Juicer function is not much useful,4.4,B07MKMFKPG,1,0,1,1,3,0,24,17,17,27,409.170.984.455.958
"Good Pen at Low Cost,... have been reading about this pen which I would like to answer,Decent (at this price),Very nice.,Not for speedy write...,Nice pen good quality could be more smoother,Smooth,Superb Fountain Pen for all types of users",First of All Delivery of Amazon It was as specified no delays Hence appreciate itPackaging Not Good The box was tempered torn and damagedProduct Ordered Black received brown Didnt replace as the Color didnt much mattered Issue is with the seller thoughPerformance The pen of good Robust feels cheap however looking at the price not to complain Writes smoothFor anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens can start with this as it does the jobEdited Have been using this pen for over days now I am facing issue of nib dryness If I dont use the pen for sometime The pen doesnt write at all I have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing It writes great when it starts writing But the initial pick up is really bad I have a platinum preppy too Its a better option to go with if the budget is tight However there we have good writing but bad looksFew points I have been reading about this pen which I would like to answer Compared with two other pens Parker Vector and Luxor V Grip Read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the curve at the grip which makes it awkward to hold Honestly have not felt so at all The grip is pretty medium larger than Parker Vector and comparable to the Luxor V It wont create any problems holding it I am an average and people of same build hand and finger size wont be any problem Also on Parker Vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages Been nice to hold the Elegante and feel firm in hand it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance Nib and feeder It says Fine on the nib and it is comparable to the Luxor V and Parker Fine nib Few claim it is medium kinds Its all about the pressure on puts when writing it I just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does so would say it is Fine It is way too smoooooother and fluent than Parker which felt a bit rough Parker Fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience However on Elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper It is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides The feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience The writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging This ensures that one gets to write about pages ie sides without a refill Plastic construction and feel in hand The cap is made of brassas they say The cap has a matte finish not a glossy one The clip and top is glossy Gives a fair enough good contrast to add some looks to it when taking it out of the pocket D The pen itself very much plastic If I try to weigh both the cap and pen separately roughly they feel of same weight it is that light weight just a feel factor how I felt However this does not mean it is a cheap construction It has fallen from floors down and did not crack anywhere so would say its good strong plastic It makes one feel pretty solid holding it The size if compared to other two is larger It rests pretty well in between my thumb and index fingerwhich parker does not Luxor does hence never needed to put the clip on the rear Without the clip it is very much balanced Parker and Luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top with clip Elegante and Parker feel a bit top heavy Ink filling Personally always been a fan of eyedroppersgood old school days however this comes with the standard piston filling as seen in the photo by Hari When I immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half Had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled In parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient For Luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious Some other reviews I read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper Few said it worked few said it leaked Need to substantiate it Not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece If anyone has tried would love to hear your experience Writing after weeks For Luxor it works immediately Even after months it worked like magic For Parker bit of dipping or couple of splashing out and it starts For Elegante it did not start immediately From school days used to have an Airmail unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted it used to work like a beauty even after weeks Elegante on this aspect did not fair so well However how many of us are not going to use their Pen for weeks always something to write sign or pen down It worked fairly after a break of one week Colour Personally the looks of a pen hardly matter to me Its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul We pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks For few people this matters more individual choice and nothing against it Parker gives a good classy look Luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive Elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both Neither a college going look nor an Executive look On looks it does fair enough justice The cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart Would have loved if they would have made more colours than Maroon Black and Blue Nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what Reynolds have bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them This does enough for me Spare Nibs and feeder Not sure if there are spare nibs available online I am at a location which is s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers lticaptd After using this nib I would personally not place any other nib I am pretty happy about it always good habit to have spare nibs dont know when one drops it and needs to change Recommended for Its a must for student At this price range where one is still studying and not earning this sounds a good buy though not the best as Luxor beats this is VFM Parker would never recommend it for students If someone wants to carry it for exams carry atleast all due to the limited piston converter capacity Luxor would be best If you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives This is fair on looks and pleasure for writing Value for Money For a standard person like me or a student Luxor beats Elegante and Parker However for a fountain pen This is an excellent VFM Well this sums up my experience after using it Anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it First of all it came in a really bad condition The package was almost flattened All thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery Thank God it doesnt have any dent Secondly it is probably a used product Because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box Thirdly the brand claims that it is having a fine nib but probably according to the European standards I am a Pilot lover so I know what fine nib is This is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of Pilot Using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm You remember the experience for a long time The handwriting also becomes better Thats lacking in this pen Thankfully it doesnt squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens I had two Wingsungs Those were unbearably squirty Fourthly the grip is average Fifthly if you are a beginner you may go for it as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens You may use it as a day to day penBUT DONT STICK WITH THIS ONE ONLY EXPLORE THE WORLD OF PILOT IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET TRUST ME YOU WONT LOOK BACK TO A PEN LIKE THIS I WAS GIFTED A PILOT CROCODILE FINE NIB BY MY MOM I WANT TO KEEP MY MEMORIES WITH THIS PEN SAFE SO I DONT USUALLY USE THAT THATS WHY IVE BOUGHT THIS ONE Lastly and most importantly a suggestion to the buyers to make your pen experience ergonomic please dont put the cap on the backside Open the cap keep it aside and unleash your writingvery nice pen its really amazing very smooth writingthank you seller amazonIts not for speedy writing if you are use for signature its cutting off character Some time spread over ink And some time character cutting Cheap plastic product but at a good for beginnersIve been using this pen for about monthsprosBuild quality for this price is amazinggold Nib looks amazingconsNib comes out easilyJust that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to Guys I have started using fountain pens again a few months back I had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like COLLEGE brand eye droppers Camlin Parker made in USA Hero China made Recently I am using Platinum Preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is Japan made This the Camlin Elegante is our very own Made in India pen It makes us proud Just superb pen Very smooth It is actually a no nonsense pen Only thingsince I had read a few negative reviews about thisI am using it with PILOT BLUE ink I dont know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what Whatever it may beThis pen with Pilot ink combination rocksjust superb experience of writing with THE FOUNTSIN PEN Thank you Camlin and Thank you Amazon,4.1,B00LY17RHI,1,0,1,1,2,0,20,18,18,22,409.170.984.455.958
"It takes Forever - to transfer anything. Maybe I - misunderstood ""Ultra"" or somebody missed ""Ultra-Slow"" in the model tag line.,Comprehensive Review of Product, Company & Seller,Desigh and usage,Good purchase not best,Sd card,Good Quality product,Pendrive Quality to Aacchi H Par , Storage 64 Gb Ki jagah 61 Gb Hi Milta H 3Gb Kam Milta H,Good",UpdateI returned the drive with money reverted backSeller was cooperative reverted without hassle or communicationABOUT THE BRAND SANDISK xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSanDisk is an IsraeliAmerican manufacturer of flash memory products including memory cards and readers USB flash drives and solid state drives As of February it is the thirdlargest manufacturer of flash memorySanDisk was founded in by Eli Harari Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president the CEOOn May SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US billion dealWHY A DUAL DRIVE WHY GB WHY SANDISKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the musclemerits or the key features of the device lets have a quick look upon my personal selection processDual Drive Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized in todays comfortseeking world whos will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it then fit it in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement GB This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage price future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size GB ensures that you wont have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basisSandisk In the recent few years Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization quality and brand image offers the best value for money deals for an average usageMoreover could not find much reputed brands in the Storage with OTG featureA Note Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend SamsungABOUT OUR PRODUCTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The device comes with the title SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive m and is the newer version of its previous iteration Here I need to quote that the term Ultra came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed With a microUSB connector on one end and a USB connector on the other the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones tablets with micro USB ports only or laptopsBoth the connectors are carved out of metal the USB connector is backwardcompatible with USB ports SIZE The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplacedThe USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and inches when expanded at USB end CONSTRUCTION The device has a plastic body the overall construction of the drive is just average The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and wont give up so easily Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief FIT FINISH Being equipped with a retractable mechanism being too small the drive is not so smooth to use slidein or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving sizeThe USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy STORAGE FORMAT Since the previous FAT version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of GB for a single file NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesnt have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well So our drive has only ex FAT NTFS formats to choose comes in ex FAT by default with KB file allocation size Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too Changing it from to KB increased my write speeds from MBs to MBs if thats a relief to anyoneThe format would surely work well with most of the TVs tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesnt work SPEED The demerit detail I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this there were not many options for dual OTG device So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchaseMy basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile However when I was transferring movies of a total size GB it started showing minutes which kept on getting higher it felt like waiting forever for it to happenEven for a single movie of GB it took minutes sec by stopwatch to transfer The write speeds started with MBsec and went down down to MBsec Even with my older Kingston DT elite GBthe write speeds were in excess of MBSecI admit I have a USB port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever The tagline Ultra and mentioned speeds of MBsec which I suppose is the rated max speeds at USB ports felt like a dream and beyond exaggerationFinally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying Even in NTFS format speeds were the sameI had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement not reversalI know that readwrite speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type format configuration of drive configuration of host destination device etcBenchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of MB size were MBs Read MBs write which looked like a mere consolation Transfer between my Samsung S mobile S tablet too was not fastVerdict Yes my friends all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe San disk should retag it as Ultraslow STORAGE Out of the total name plate rating of GB the actual allocated space for usage is around GB which is ok enough WARRANTY The product comes with a year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers PRICE I bought the device for bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size Dual drive brand image MRP over the pack was printed bucks it was tagged made in Malaysia Only if it was a bit fasterFINAL VERDICTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all in my personal opinion given the brand image Ultratagline modern day technology advancements even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low Read Write ratesEven for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price It could have been a great allrounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of Sandisk years of warranty had its speed been any betterCOVERED HERE Actual storage space Heating Mobile Phones Tight Fitting on mobile phones Speed Formatting File System Value for Money Free App Company Brand SellerAbout Company Product Seller SanDisk Ultra is a brand of Western Digital which is the same company that sells external harddisk storage devices under the brand WD Elements and WD Portable About to years ago WD Elements Portable drives of TB and TB were priced Rs less than current day prices They were sold by Cloudtail Seller on Amazon Now SanDisk and WD drives are sold by Appario Retail Seller on Amazon For best prices on SanDisk and WD products in India the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products Reason for higher prices for same brands same capacity storage devices may be various such as import duties taxes manufacturing costs higher demand for the brand etcREVIEW SanDisk Ultra Dual GB USB OTG Pen Drive Gold STORAGE SPACE Just as in external harddisk drives the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product SAME AS OTHERS For the GB pen drive actual storage space available is GB This is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement This is because it has FAT File System Also the device uses some space for its functionality and use In Linux OS laptop the available storage space on this FAT pen drive is shown to be GB So thats GB more than what Windows OS calculates using their NTFS File System HEATING Even with just minutes of use you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated But the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat This heating does not happen in WD external harddisks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands MOBILE PHONES The pen drive works with Android OS of Mi phones such as Redmi Note running Android including old Android Version as well TOO TIGHT FOR PHONES The pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones tablets so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone because this is also the charging point for your phone If you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management VALUE FOR MONEY Even if you dont use this pen drive for mobile phone it is still the best price for a GB pen drive with a USB backward compatible with older USB ports on older laptops and computers SPEED The Speed is extremely good for Windows OS laptop Linux OS laptop and Android Mobile Phones FILE SYSTEM FORMATTING THE PEN DRIVE Unless you are sure you wont use your pen drive on a particular device dont format the pen drive to change its FAT File SystemBut For Example If you have decided that you wont use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you dont want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop With NTFS formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive With your Linux systems file format you will have better storage space than any Windows File System BEWARE that if the pen drive has NTFS File System then it wont work with mobile phones tablets laptops which dont have Windows Operating System Same way if you format the pen drive for Linux OS File System it wont be recognised on Windows laptops Android phones tablets etc if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or coworkers then leave the existing FAT File System as it is FREE APP Memory Zone App for Android is bundled free in this pen drive It is easy to install and doesnt take any Phone Permissions other than Storage Access It is very useful App with easy userinterface App takes MB storage space on Android Phones Features include cleaning Junk Files that you may not otherwise know through your phones File Manager App Enable or Disable Automatic Backup to your pen drive Add Cloud Storage such as Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive and Add MicroSD card storage to manage all your files from just one Memory Zone

throughout the day without gamingDisplay very colourful being amoled But only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display But that was only once I hope it doesnt occur againEdit It

burns in far future in amoled display of all samsung mobilesHeating I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time But its not muchWant to know how much heat I feel Well it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low batteryPerformance No issue as others are making it out to be You can play many games its just not smooth in heavy games In daily usage it doesnt lagI have used SD before this has MTK G so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD OR we can even say it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD I didnt play heavy games on this phone but I did play games of about GB on my previous phone which had SD So I think those games will work here without lag as wellTip Just because some people got defective piece doesnt mean you will too And if you do see any manufacturing defect then you can always place a replacement

But for Outdoor activities it will not meet our expectations.,Awesome product",Bahut hi achha product hai badhiya saund and bluetooth connectivityBuild material is plastic body However sound was goodNiceSound quality is goodBattery performance goodIt is a satisfactory Bluetooth speaker and is perfect choice for those who are looking for a budget wireless speaker for their laptop or mobile phone with low volume issues or for those who need some portable music device and who dont want to shell out lot of money It serves these purpose very well and is not pricey Why I am saying all thisFirst things first I got this at the black one only as rest of the colors were way too pricey and choice of colors can be sacrificed in such a case My laptop and phone volume is too low and watching a video or listening to music on these devices is not a good experience So here too this speaker served the purpose as connectivity is excellent size of speaker is conveniently small lightweight and battery backup is damm awesome After a complete charge I used this speaker for continuously for about hours at about volume and still the speaker is left with charge I cannot comment right now for the charging time as it arrived with more than charge and I just topped it to full Bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally good upto mtrs FM reception is average without connecting the datacharging cable but it is awesome if the cable is connected It has only four buttons and all the functions are controlled by these buttons only First button M is mode which when pressed switches from Bluetooth to FM to Aux to Usbmemory card Transition of switching is flawless Volume updown keys are used to change volume and switch the channels Long press changes the volume and short pressclick changes the channels in FM or changes the track via Aux Most usefull feature of this speaker is its mic Yes you can actually use this speaker when connected to phone to talk with someone and that too with no connectivity issues Voice clarity is very good for the calls made MUSIC CLARITY IS NOT VERY GOOD READ CONS FOR THIS Quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durableCONS Sound quality is just average Voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant But when it comes to music this speaker struggles to deliver quality People are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality This is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality But this is manageable and you can ADJUST THE MUSIC EQUALIZERS in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality This is the reason I dont consider its music quality a con for the product Theres one limitation about charging connector to It comes with a charging port compatible to AB type connector so if you have a charger with data cable supporting C type connectors you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only So you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker Instead you will have to carry two different cables This speaker does not come with a charger so you will have to use your mobiles charger v A for the purpose But for the price rage this seems reasonableUseful tip for buyers Most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker But you can install any of these two apps Bluebatt or Bluetooth check ringtone and show battery level from the playstore if in case your phone is unable to fetch battery data from speakerWhat you get in complete package unit of Bluetooth speaker cable which has Aux connector USB connector and AB type micro Usb connector tiny user manualQuality of packaging Excellent sturdy packaging used by Cloudtail to secure the companys product packaging Manufacturing date was of MayI like itPortability and Bluetooth connection is goodAwesome,3.9,B07YNTJ8ZM,1,1,1,1,2,1,3,2,3,5,409.170.984.455.958

"VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT WITH WORST AFTER SALES SERVICE FROM EUREKA FORBES!,Water Taste and TDS level and Filter age,Good product but not good service after installation,Excellent Product for its price,Good product | Eureka Forbes took time for installation,Water wastage is ~220%.,Great product this RO purifier,Awesome product",Product and Service ReviewBuying price during prime day sale with discount from HDFC DEBIT CARDPRODUCT REVIEWRATING This is a new model launched during prime day from Eureka Forbes Aquaguard line of products named Aquasure delightThe product is pleasant to look and comes with a capacity of l on paper but holds only liters of water equipped with reverse osmosis ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solidscan be manually adjusted only by service engineer the liter tank fills at about mins but the water wastage is very high for every litre water purified there is a drainage of litre from the drain pipe please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing shaving or watering plants The drained water is same as tank water just with higher TDS The water taste varies according to the level of TDS you choose very low TDS will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which I will not recommend The default TDS after purification is set somewhere between drinking water should have TDS below MANUFACTURER REVIEWRATING The manufacturer of this product is Eureka Forbes I am giving a rate of because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that I received was a defective one The drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full I asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so I received a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OUT OF THE BOX I ordered for a replacement on Amazon which they processed and I got another one in which the led lights were displaced I dont know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect I would have been disappointed for the second time but I observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside The replaced products valve is functional and now operating without any hassleSERVICE REVIEWDont expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache The reasons are The people Eureka Forbes has employed as technicians are thieves I am saying this because Aquasure Delight comes with INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the Aquaguard inlet as I hadnt opened the package when it arrived because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product mostly electrical items that need installation like TVs Washing machines Taking the precaution I didnt open the box so I was unaware that DIVERTER is included in the package The technician after fitting the diverter charged Rs saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package i came to know this when I opened the package of the replaced product and found THE DIVERTER INCLUDED ALONG and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some dont I still have to confirm this with Eureka Forbes The pre filter doesnt come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices My technician sold it to me at Rs which is available at Amazon at Rs but then if had ordered it from Amazon I have to install it by myself I dont have a drill etc so I had to pay him Rs so loss of Rs on the technician My opinion on this is that Eureka Forbes SHOULD SELL WATER PURIFIERA WITH PRE FILTER even though it raises the cost of the product by Rs to Rs PLATFORM REVIEWThe platform in which I bought is of course Amazon I am giving it a rating of because I received a defective product the first time and Amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by Amazon Amazon never raises an installation request unlike Flipkart which raises an installation request from its side which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation Flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem For installation you have to call the Eureka Forbes toll free number and raise an installation request so Amazon representative was demanding an INSTALLATION REPORT a video or photo proof of the problem now how could I make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video I got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as I found it defective to put it up for replacement but I didnt know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic productSUMMARY PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR THE MENTIONED PRICEAQUASURE COMES WITH INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE A STAINLESS STEEL DEVICE THAT IS ATTACHED TO YOUR WATER OUTLET AND THE AQUAGUARD DONT LET YOUR TECHNICIAN CHARGE YOU FOR IT THE TECHNICIAN WILL OVERCHARGE YOU FOR PRE FILTER BE READY FOR THAT TECHNICIANS ARE CUNNING AND MOSTLY THIEVES SO BE SHARP AROUND THEM MAKE SURE PRODUCT IS NOT DEFECTIVE IF IT IS AMAZON IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME REPLACING IT AMAZON WILL NOT RAISE AN INSTALLATION REQUEST YOU HAVE TO RAISE IT BY YOURSELF BY CALLING EUREKA FORBES CUSTOMER CAREOVERALL VERDICT if your family in members you have choice eureka Forbes delight ROUVTDS this product is very effective and efficient Agua guard provides installation with in hours of delivery before the installation had TDS level is and after the installation had TDS level is Nice product by Aquaguard water taste is also sweetThis is very good water purifier but I see service guy for installation seems in hurry He just installed and went off He did not show how much is TDS how to adjust it Dont buy this product on Amazon Buy it from local stores if possibleI purchased this product on a heavy Festival discount There was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob I reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged Although I had to wait for about two weeks The Serviceman came and installed another piece Since then it is working excellently In all the best part was that the services were good and responsiveAmazon part of the business was smoothDelivery done within timelines Payments exchange cashback all done hassle freeEureka Forbes another storyFor installation I had to call them daily for daysFinally on escalation and on hold with Eureka Forbes customer service for close to minutes installation was doneEureka Forbes now calls me every other day to force this reviewMy main reason for writing this reviewI got the Purifier installed and before that I was having Bislery water reason why I have so many bottles which thankful came handy The Deliver and Installation was smooth After installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the st batch of filtered water since its the st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overallSo I decided to let it full up and once it was full I turned off the switch so no more whater comes in I used the empty L Bislery bottles to fill up the st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around L as Mentioned by the CompanyAfter I emptied the Filter to its last drop I turned on the filter with another set of Empty bottles at the waste pipe side It took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost L worth of bottles as seen in the image This is roughly or more than twice the amount of filtered waterNow the company claims water saved in comparison to other ROUV filters and I have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do But I think its a bit much regardlessFir every L of purified water it wastes LMy tal water TDS is Filtered water TDS is And the waste water TDS is Maybe its because of the TDS levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and its possible that the amount might vary for different TDS levels at sourceBut I recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down L almost everyday wasted is L per month and this is considering you only filter L of water per dayIll redo this once more to see if theres any difference in values This is juts to keep the potential buyers informedI like speed to fill water n less wastage I like Tds adjuster and easy to install I dont like internal plastic body though I believe its steel need confirmation Overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from weeksDeserve a star on product However ran into a problem when it comes to installation The technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation At last one technician came forward,4,B09YLWT89W,1,0,1,1,2,0,15,3,3,17,409.170.984.455.958

increase volume or not giving the sound that we heard when it installedsetup Played the same content which we listen in Youtube when after installation completedRegarding this yesterday raised request online service person asked me to update build version to latest Now it is PL but still have the same problem or days ago while watching suddenly TV got turned off We did power off and on then it got switch on usually also after sometime did screen mirroring of youtube and tried decreasing volume from mobile it worked But not sure what problem we believe after that time onwards we have this sound issuesNot sure seems as I bought from this Amazon or MI service itself does magic to convey customer without actually solving problemOnline service person instead sending Technician to home for verifying problem Told and did build version update with me to latest Software update Later he said Volume limit got increased to now we have to increase the volume level double or triple to have same sound which have prior ie Before if volume level gives big sound then now volume level the same sound Asked when limit increased it should give much more sound otherwise what is the use of Volume limit increase But he told OTTsome apps will show difference of this new feature at the time as I have been on this calls and worries got tired I said will see and get back to you with new requestAfter some time when I visited my friends better knowledge person on this problem came to know that he cheated me without solving problem simply said some words to conveytired usOff course I can hear sound at or Volume but my concern is after purchaseinstallation of days only I got this problem in future how it works and how many further problems shows to me making me cruiseBeing middle

READ ON!,Excellent sound quality, i like this speaker sooooooo much 👌👌👌",This is review is primarily focused on sound qualityThe term Bass is used losely One doesnt expect true Bass from such small driversSHORTER VERSIONBoat Stone Very loud Loud and somewhat uneven bass Mids are a bit supressed Somewhat muffled midrange Decent treble A loud bassy speakerNakamichi Speck Barely louder than the W Stone Mids clearer than Bass much much lower than If looking for VFM rule this one out unless this is on a big discount and others arent Overall fairly even sound at a questionable price and volumeBoat More bass than expected of a tiny W speaker but lesser than Speck and way lesser than Excellent midrange and terble Much lounder than what you may expect of a W speaker Amazing speaker in a tiny package with insufficent bassLONGER VERSIONI have had the for years and many have asked me to order it for them It is an excellent tiny satisfying package The midrange vocals and treble is excellent and matches speakers several times it price If bass is not what you are after you are unlikely to find a better package even at a much higher price point especially if you care for even soundBy Even Sound I mean all relevant frequencies produced fairly well no major suppression or enhancementI checked the others as I usually hear music on a semipro system and the insufficent bass lowermids bothered meNakamichi USED to be a Japanese company making very high end tape decks in the s so the benchmarks were high now it is a China based company The W raised expectations further As said it is barely louder than the W Stone It is fairly even sound but not a significant enough improvement in bass over the If you dont care about the money and want something better than the with even sound this could be it The mids and terble are a tiny bit better in the Speck also has a larger battery giving substantially longer backup and better water protection useful if you use yours in the smallest room of the house The Stone is miles ahead in bass and loudness if that is what you care for amongst the your choice is simple The bass is uneven however All three speakers have memberanes in the inner shell acting as passive bass radiators One should not expect much nuance in bass from those If a thump is what you care for yes it is certainly there for the size With somewhat uncontrolled bass the midrange is compromised somewhat suppressed and somewhat muffled No it is not major and many mgiht not even really notice it much The transiton between mid and lowermidsbass isnt great One usually doesnt expect as much from such speakers but the Boat Stone set the bar high very highKeep the boat stone at an angle such that the drivers speaker are in the direction of your ears It makes the midrange a bit better Reduces the bass a bit but makes the sound more even Tough it is impractical to keep it so it makes the sound a lot closer to what I desireSOME EXTRASPlacement of these speakers makes a big difference Keep them about away from a wall ideally a corner for enhanced bass and fuller soundIf you look at teardown videos youll notice that the has much bigger magnets than the others It is a heavy speaker I like that since it keeps it stable and the rubber on the side helps further It is well designed except the and volume buttons should have been interchanged for intuitive useThe can also be placed vertically That too changes the sound Lesser bass and possibly a bit clearer on the whole reduced bass less intrusion into the mids in such speakersSpeaker characterics change subtly over odd hours of use Often quite prominent in the first hour so do not form an opnion before running them in for about an hourConclusionNakamichi Speck More even sound than the other two not at all as loud as expected better waterprof rating bigger battery high priced despite Chinese Buy if you dont care for the money volume and are okay wihtout much bassBoat Stone it is a star Excellent even sound however the lack of bass as compared to the others pulls it back If you are on a budget or if you dont care much for bass especially for lecturesdocumentaries or vocal music this is brilliant I have used it for longBoat Heavy Loud Lots of bass If you can deal with the somewhat and it is not big unevenness and slightly muffled sound it is a good packageFor my needs I added the to my equipment list while keeping the PS This was my way of giving back to the community for the numerous reviews I have gained fromSoundIts okay to buySound is not much loud its below my expectations Low price Awesome sound Battery life should be more so cutting down star but overall good Gives feeling of home theatre Multiple connectivity is also goodLoved the product,4.2,B07NC12T2R,0,1,1,1,0,1,8,3,4,8,409.170.984.455.958

"Very useful product - but hardware is not so sturdy,Great Customer Support,Overall a good Indian product.,Really good to help internet running during power cuts,Good product and effective customer support,Value for money,Does Not support 4 hours as per the description,No backup at all",I used this product for about months and really had no issues with it until I noticed that my internet stopped working After getting it checked I found out that the issue was in the UPS maybe wiring cable which stopped transmissionI contacted the customer care and I was assisted by Mr Ankit He was very helpful and asked me to demonstrate the issue in video and tried to ascertain the issue through other checkups too After ascertaining that the issue is in the product he confirmed to get the default product replaced and started the issue and informed me on tentative timelines for the same Hoping to receive the replacement soon so that I can continue uninterrupted internet I have been using this product for the past four months during this tenure I had faced no issues initially but roughly after months the power back up started shrinking extremely and the least duration was under minutes thats when I contacted the customer support via whatsapp and I must say the whole experience with the customer support team was simply surprising They were very polite and helpful throughout the process It was very easy for me to explain the issue to them then at the end of the first conversation itself they arranged a replacement for the product since it is just months old They took all the responsibility of the issue and sent me a new product which I am currently using now the back up I am getting is hours which is based on my usageSo finally I am not sure how often I buy a product from this brand but I will never forget the support I received from this this brand CheersI purchased the product days back and initial product was not working properly But I received a replacement for that Thanks for immediate response from the support team I liked Oakter because its Indian product and NOT a Chinese As of now its working fine and no lag in WiFi connection or speed Need to test the recharge capacity when the Power goes off Will keep you updated after a month again by checking the results Giving Stars as of nowThis is a really good option for those who are primarily concerned about being cut off from online meetingscalls due to frequent short term power cuts and are not willing to spend more amount buying an inverter I have been using this product since around months and am pretty happy with its backupI have been using the product for more than a year Later I purchased a second product for my parents home and it was working fine for months However the backup battery stopped working later and the customer support team were quick to respond and swiftly sent me the replacement productProduct was delivered very promptly and packaging was good Using this product just from couple of days and its working as expected Very easy to plug use Reserving star for longevity of this product will revise my rating after a year or so depending on my experienceThe device doesnt support for hours It support only for or hours minutes max on full rechargeProduct is affordable light and good Please dont fool on hours support capacity Resonate UPS is better as compared to thisThis product claims to give backup for upto hours But it wont even give backup for mins I claimed warranty and got the new product as well still the same problem They reiterate and say upto hours where they shud mention clearly that it will give backup upto hour not more than thatOne of the worst customer support services i have seen The associates keep repeating the same sentence or copy paste the chat and dont provide solutions Totally disappointed and waste of money Never recommending anyone to buy their product,4.1,B08HLZ28QC,1,0,1,1,2,0,9,3,3,11,409.170.984.455.958

"Small, not too heavy, good looking.,Quality of material,Nice product,Good,One of the Best Mouse for the price,Good holding good dpi easy to use,Value for money,Nice mouse",Hi guys Bought this yesterday so havent used it much so an early review But the most detailed review so please read till the end Very important points are mentionedLooks are cute It looks really nice and elegant I am using it with a MacBook Air So far it seems there are no problems using it The scrolling is smooth connection does not drop and there is no lag Connection is instant There is no pairing required Its plug and play along with the dongle provided with itIt sits low on the table feels weighty but not in a wrong way The battery adds to its weight but I have used heavier mice before and this one feels just right It has good grip Nothing to complain about thatButtons are nice and clicks are satisfactory not too noisy they are just right Scroll wheel doesnt feel cheap at all though I believe it couldve been better quality Body is matt finish and doesnt leave fingerprints on it though if youre someone who eats and handles the mouse then itll show the oil prints and thats true with any peripherals The mouse doesnt feel cheap overall but it is definitely plasticky though not in the bad sense It is definitely not cheap looks wiseThere is an on off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery which is included when the mouse is not in use There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light So thats a good thing and a definite plus The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with itNow over to a major flaw The mouse connects only though its own usb dongle which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself inside the battery door which I found mighty impressive and not through the laptops bluetooth Now this means two things You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario And worse still if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle then youre stuck and I dont think you get only the dongle youll have to check that with the seller and then the mouse is left useless in that case Now over to the problem I am facing which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews I use a MacBook so it doesnt have USBC inputs which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector which is not cheap because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse but consider this point It is very important It will NOT connect over MacBooks Bluetooth Otherwise it works well with the MacBook The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level is too slow and on level is too fast Youll have to get used to that thing It doesnt feel very natural as the trackpad on the MacBook feels because of that speed problem but otherwise the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesnt jump around at least with my mouse Also the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad and I feel it could have been made better But I guess at the cost you really cant complain too muchOverall I think a good buy but the compulsion of having to use it with its own dongle is a major drawback I feel If that doesnt bother you then nothing else should keep you from buying this product especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than bucks which is what it cost meThe quality of power button is very low easily it can breakNice Product works as expected as of now no issuesGoodVery smooth works on almost every surface paper table cloth etcTheres a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons rightleft clicksIt will not bother most of you I am a bit Obsessive with these kind of things SoPersonally I opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button resulting in no rattle sound Now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons click click clickBattery life of Logitech is known to be very goodQuality good dpi good good accuracy on off switch available smooth good deal at reasonable pricegood product on which you can use for long timeThis is good mouse thanks to Amazon for providing this product at reasonable price Very sharp and correct working mouse,4.4,B01J0XWYKQ,1,0,1,1,3,0,13,4,4,16,409.170.984.455.958

"👎Disappointed 👎Review after 1 year 3 months of usage,Good product and received latest V4,Good Budget Gigabit Router with Beamforming and multiple options in firmware,Range is issue for 5g every where,Value For Money,Go for it,Super 👍,Signal, support, install",I really liked this router for a smallish space The coverage never dropped and was mostly consistentHowever it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet Apparently the Ethernet port got damaged somehow I tried calling TP Link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is Its the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a years usage And to make it worse theres dismal after sales serviceI tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasnt stable I think Ill finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers Hopefully Ill find a good maker Good RouterAfter researching lot I settled on TP link AI was looking for better range router this Router really worth the price Dual band guest wifi I upgraded from tenda n and performance is really goodRange for Gz is not that good as Gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than thisI was using Tenda AC router since for Mbps connection from Local ISP Mach Broadband Mumbai Most of devices Mobiles Laptops Firestick at my home work on Ghz except CCTV camera Range of Tenda AC was good and used Digisol AC repeater for farthest room of my BHK homeIn recent lightning strike in Mumbai power adapter of Tenda AC got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter I was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget I tried routers Mercusys AC MRG TP Archer C AC before this Both Routers didnt meet my expectation Range and speed of these routers were poor than my earlier Tenda AC Amazon accepted returns without a single question Thumbs up to AmazonAfter some more research I zeroed on TP link Archer A C As per comparison on TP link website both are identical routers After doing some more research on blogs and reviews I found that Archer A is the latest model and had slightly better processor both from Qualcomm Hence purchased Archer A Feature of Onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future Separate Wifi SSID with same strength on both Ghz as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser as per TP link support page this is dedicated wifi link for Onemesh repeatersNow for router Router is same as Tenda AC for coverage it can not cover farthest room in BHK on Ghz Ghz band can cover BHK house but speed is around Mbps on Mbps plan However speed on Archer A is better that Tenda AC Im getting Mbps upload and download consistently on devices feet apart in Ghz TP Link Archer A is better than costlier AC routers Just for info I received US version v of router instead of EU version mentioned on TP Link India website Hence firmware on TP Link India website will not match with device firmware However this device has auto update option directly from Internet Also router can be managed by TPLink Tether app remotely on internet even tough not connected on same wifi by login using TP link account on both router and Tether appBy trying so many routers i understood that Ghz range will be week even with costliest router Instead of using Digisol AC repeater i installed my old Tenda AC in repeater mode for Ghz Ghz disabled Now my complete home is covered by Ghz signal In the farthest room i receive download upload speed of around MbpsI also tried old TP link Archer C which i had purchased when abroad performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks Gigabit ports Beamforming MUMIMOMy ISP has connected my link on Gigabit port of their switch in my society However cabling is only pair CAT e which supports max Mbps full duplex I will try to get cabling changed to either Pair CAT E or CAT from ISP and check the performance I will update review after cabling changeSo in the nutshell i would recommend to go for router with Gigabit ports Beamforming MUMIMO even if your internet speed is less than Mbps as it is future proof TP Lnk Archer A is good router meeting all requirement within the budgetHope this review is useful in search of good futureproof routerEdit My ISP tried to replace my connection to FTTH and this router was connected to Fiber ONU using Gigabit Port It worked only for mins Max speed was Mbps ISP was not able to resolve the FTTH issue and changed cable to Pair CATe which supports Gigabit transmission Now net speed is around Mbps My internet plan is Mbps Im happy with the speed I have asked ISP to change my connection to FTTH at last Tenda AC is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of Archer A using CATe cable Now complete home received stable wifi of Mbps on Ghz bandI will update once again when FTTH connection is successfulGood product till now monthI am very SatisfiedI am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi disconnected and I used to reconnect it and the same way VPN is keep getting reconnecting in my laptop hence my teams call used to disconnect during the meeting Now I am happy with this product where my vpn is not reconnecting even internet goes down and if any flatuations in the network as well Finally i am not seeing any issue with this router It is helping me during work from home Please go aheadIts easy to use easy to install more function to control the router,4.4,B07W9KYT62,1,0,1,1,2,0,8,4,4,10,409.170.984.455.958

"Excellent coffee maker,Sturdy quality product!,Good product,Just go for it!,Mokapot's upward filteration is messy,i felt its more of a joy to prepare concoction in this espresso maker,Good product,Espresso quality",The quality of coffee maker is excellent a DM very ease on making coffee and getting served hotThe silver color is much better compared to stainless steel finish Lov my coffee made in this This should be advertised as suited for cups not Does the job well and even after placing directly on the stove there is no discolouration Steel quality is upto markI have been using this product for a while and have no complaints Makes amazing filter coffeeLooks and quality are at par with other brands in its price bracket In function this kind of a mokapot design is flawed at the cleaning aspect including this particular model in my observation In it the pressured boiling water pushes through the coffee powder in bulk together thus rendering the flavour inferior to what is brewed otherwise when the water percolates little by little Secondly the portafilter type coffee powder container positioned just above the boiler chamber sends some dissolved coffee back to the boiler water through the upward pressure pipe rendering the entire remainder water mixed with coffee go waste Thirdly the coffee powder containers gasketted mesh is sedimented too while filtering the forced brew upward So when a person like me thinks of preparing a brew in a mokapot like mechanism the very thought of the predicament of dismantling the the tiered chambers separating the gasket and then wash the pot thoroughly because coffee is lurking everywhere therein to cause unhygienic residues dampens my desire to go for it I am no debater if the idea is to leave the pot just rinsed and washed and not rid it of the residues All this is not the case with the downward filteration method of the other types of coffee machines that are absolutely unmessy No offense meant for any system this is my personal opinionI like the convenience of making coffee for people in one goIts very easy to clean it up after every use Its rust free and looks beautiful while kept on kitchen counter even idlyLike and good productOrdered this for my stay in India it worked the way it should be it has silicone washers easy cleaning Product quality can be improved OK product not WOW,4.2,B095K14P86,1,0,1,1,2,0,3,4,4,5,409.170.984.455.958

"Really a Good Buy in this price range in 2022,Expected better Battery,Over-all a very balanced product.,Poor Battery life,Good,Temper glasses not istalle properly,It's 8 gb not working like 12gb,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.",Verdict A Solid buy for this price segment in and even for early There are reviews in this section Review is days after purchase Typos in the Review has rectified now and Review is days post Android beta update These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on August Before OOS update G only for Jio was enabled via another update G is still not available in my region Hence G related parameters are not covered in this reviewReview After about days of Oxygen OS Beta update Android Update received on Dec Note After the beta update no new issues popped upie there wereNo Heating related issuesNo fast battery drainNo change in the Charging timeNo annoying bugsNo change in camera performanceBeta update is mostly like a Stable updateOOS Android update reviewDelighters No new apps added Absolutely NOT System storage consumption remains the same GB Animations are more fluidic More customization UI features added Scout widgets in home screen Enlarged folder lot more Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor Ability to play videos in the background screen OFF as well even for YouTube Really a welcoming longing feature which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF Standby battery life has improved substantiallyDisappointers Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before No improvement in Sound levels Still initial is too silent No Dolby Atomos which was mentioned for OOS Perhaps to wait for Stable update Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier Response time is tad increased Haptics have become tighter than earlier but still not strongerReview Verdict A Good Buy in this price range in Note This review is after a months usage Received updates during the course of time Recent update was of GB System consumes GB space GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage N band is missing for G The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue Shifting from a Hz to this Hz mobile No noticeable difference observed In Nongaming aspect Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parametersThings that are delighting Exceptional signal reception especially G carrier aggregation Very fast download speeds Insane Fast charging to in mins to in mins excluding trickle charge No heating of the mobile just slight warming during charging Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic Even more than hrs for Videos YT and general tasks and calls even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver Oxygen OS Color OSRealme OS Bloatware The skin is really good nothing to complain like other brands UI Absolutely no rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any nd party apps Even some nd party apps are uninstallable No major bothering bugs noticed till date Yes the Alert slider is included unlike some premium OnePlus modelsThings that are annoying Dual ambient light sensor in rear and other in front is not well calibrated The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required Volume level is useless until level can be audible only in Pindrop silence ambience Audible enough only post level Stereo speakers output are bottom and earpiece But full volume doesnt distort is loud enough Haptics are tight but not strong even in higher levels Effective only post and best only level Hotspot drains battery quickly even a warning notification pops up Also Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm Though the inhand feel is good the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel The inbuild DAC no mm hole and only TypeC port is not great The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output Perhaps Dolby Atmos support in OOS could improve the audio outputOverall its a good mobile phone The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long Not much i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about hours on normal use not many themes available Samsung is better in that sense there are many wallpapers and themes available Display is clear and camera is also good Overall okayI got this mobile Gb Gb Ram variantat k after k discount on icici credit cardFor this price its a must buyI am using this product since last weeksThe camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very wellThe only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better as a working professional it doesnt makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a dayIf you have no issues with the battery section then just go for itBattery drains like any thing Rest all goodI have to recharge twice a day dont buy if you want a good battery backupEven though phone is fast charge I am disappointed with battery lifeI bought gb and and its working very smoothly for normal regular use you can go for itThere is problem with temper glass part front Cemera area temper glass not installingGood but not so fast as I think gb its ordinary like gb Apart from battery and sound quality

"Really a Good Buy in this price range in 2022,Expected better Battery,Over-all a very balanced product.,Poor Battery life,Good,Temper glasses not istalle properly,It's 8 gb not working like 12gb,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.",Verdict A Solid buy for this price segment in and even for early There are reviews in this section Review is days after purchase Typos in the Review has rectified now and Review is days post Android beta update These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on August Before OOS update G only for Jio was enabled via another update G is still not available in my region Hence G related parameters are not covered in this reviewReview After about days of Oxygen OS Beta update Android Update received on Dec Note After the beta update no new issues popped upie there wereNo Heating related issuesNo fast battery drainNo change in the Charging timeNo annoying bugsNo change in camera performanceBeta update is mostly like a Stable updateOOS Android update reviewDelighters No new apps added Absolutely NOT System storage consumption remains the same GB Animations are more fluidic More customization UI features added Scout widgets in home screen Enlarged folder lot more Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor Ability to play videos in the background screen OFF as well even for YouTube Really a welcoming longing feature which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF Standby battery life has improved substantiallyDisappointers Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before No improvement in Sound levels Still initial is too silent No Dolby Atomos which was mentioned for OOS Perhaps to wait for Stable update Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier Response time is tad increased Haptics have become tighter than earlier but still not strongerReview Verdict A Good Buy in this price range in Note This review is after a months usage Received updates during the course of time Recent update was of GB System consumes GB space GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage N band is missing for G The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue Shifting from a Hz to this Hz mobile No noticeable difference observed In Nongaming aspect Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parametersThings that are delighting Exceptional signal reception especially G carrier aggregation Very fast download speeds Insane Fast charging to in mins to in mins excluding trickle charge No heating of the mobile just slight warming during charging Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic Even more than hrs for Videos YT and general tasks and calls even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver Oxygen OS Color OSRealme OS Bloatware The skin is really good nothing to complain like other brands UI Absolutely no rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any nd party apps Even some nd party apps are uninstallable No major bothering bugs noticed till date Yes the Alert slider is included unlike some premium OnePlus modelsThings that are annoying Dual ambient light sensor in rear and other in front is not well calibrated The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required Volume level is useless until level can be audible only in Pindrop silence ambience Audible enough only post level Stereo speakers output are bottom and earpiece But full volume doesnt distort is loud enough Haptics are tight but not strong even in higher levels Effective only post and best only level Hotspot drains battery quickly even a warning notification pops up Also Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm Though the inhand feel is good the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel The inbuild DAC no mm hole and only TypeC port is not great The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output Perhaps Dolby Atmos support in OOS could improve the audio outputOverall its a good mobile phone The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long Not much i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about hours on normal use not many themes available Samsung is better in that sense there are many wallpapers and themes available Display is clear and camera is also good Overall okayI got this mobile Gb Gb Ram variantat k after k discount on icici credit cardFor this price its a must buyI am using this product since last weeksThe camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very wellThe only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better as a working professional it doesnt makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a dayIf you have no issues with the battery section then just go for itBattery drains like any thing Rest all goodI have to recharge twice a day dont buy if you want a good battery backupEven though phone is fast charge I am disappointed with battery lifeI bought gb and and its working very smoothly for normal regular use you can go for itThere is problem with temper glass part front Cemera area temper glass not installingGood but not so fast as I think gb its ordinary like gb Apart from battery and sound quality

"600 W heating kettle with warmer & temp control, half coil heating element looks odd,Overall a Good Electric Kettle,Overall good.,Good Multicooker within budget,Agaro esteem Multi kettle,Quality,Very nice product. Like it.❤,Nice one for hostellers. A must buy product.",I have used it mainly for boiling water knob turned maximum to right so cannot comment much about lower temperature settings It takes about min for water to boil Suggest Mfr to release in other colour like light blue etc as I see some other kettles It may add to the looks and give a warm feeling in the room The stainless steel looks shiny but the material is not very thick but its ok for the price There may be formation of scaling or white brownish spots on the base of kettle in a C shape due to the C shaped half coil at base funny design maybe a product created by modifying a higher wattage full circular coil kettle The scales are more when tap water is used due to higher presence of salts maybe They seem to get cleaned by usual scrubbing Given wide based cylinder shape it is very easy to cleanTo be aware The kettle does not autoshut off when water boils Similarly the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off Else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating I havent tested this though These are mentioned in the manual So this can be thought of as a warmer boiler So you CANNOT leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil I assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that mannerAccessories Cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided Given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated I would not suggest to use it inside the kettle in any way eg steaming A steel rack is given too That could be used alongwith some steel plate with holes for steam cooking but there is none provided with the product itselfFinal verdict If you are ok with a somewhat slower heating kettle but with more versatility and easy to clean at a reasonable price this will do the job If a similar product was available with higher wattage at a higher price I would have bought that insteadI wanted to give star rating because Agaro forces its customers to give rating and review to get the warranty It is a bad practice You cannot force customer to give rating As I mentioned it may result in the product having negative rating on Amazon despite being a good productIn my opinion the product itself is good It heats water very fast It is good for making Maggie pasta and boiling eggs But need to be careful while making Maggie or pasta because once they get dry they start to stick to the bottomThe kettle is very easy to cleanThe cord length should have been longerOne issue that I noticed that only one half of the base of kettle generates heatEverything is good it has been very useful for me There is only one drawback I guess the heating is not uniform across the base of the kettle since whenever I boil milk or make teacoffee a portion of one side bunrs the milk Even while boiling water I can see the similar symptomAgaro Multicooker is good and gives a variety of cooking boiling options like Milk Tea Eggs Maggi etcOnly negative point is that Agaro team promises extended warranty of months by giving asking to give a positive review on Amazon but fails to deliver on their promise and does not give any extended warrantyDelivery has safe got item safelyDelivery on time instantaneous water boiling sufficient space big volume best for hostel studentsHope for warranty and company responseI liked how fast it does the work but i hate about the dirt it gets inside after cooking something it sticks theirOverall gorgeous product The most beautiful thing is that the cord length is big That is a better option for your kitchen and aslo that is the best option for hostel usersLiked the design and operation However cord length could be longer Temperature control is good but knob need some modifications Overall happy with this product,4.2,B07WNK1FFN,1,0,1,1,3,0,11,4,4,14,409.170.984.455.958
"An unbiased look at the Kodak TV,Sound good,It's really worthy and the most affordable,Not bad!!!,a value TV for the price,Good in all respect,Kodak tv,Smart tv",I recently purchased the Kodak TV from Amazon and overall my experience has been satisfactory The picture quality is good and the streaming capabilities are convenient The user interface is easy to navigate although it did take me a little bit of time to get used to itHowever I do have a few issues with the TV The sound quality is not the best and I have noticed some lag when switching between apps These issues do not significantly impact my viewing experience but they are worth mentioningDespite these issues I would still give the Kodak TV stars out of It is a decent TV for the price but there are certainly better options out there I was offered an additional months of warranty if I wrote a review but I am not particularly interested in extending the warranty at this timeIt is not appropriate or ethical to write a false or misleading review in exchange for incentives such as an extended warranty or other perks Doing so goes against Amazons guidelines and can lead to consequences for both the customer and the companyIt is important to be honest and transparent in your reviews and to only write about your genuine experiences with a product This helps other customers make informed decisions about their purchases and ensures that the review system remains fair and trustworthyIf you are not satisfied with the Kodak TV or do not feel comfortable giving it a high rating it is perfectly okay to give it a lower rating or to not write a review at all It is always better to be honest and genuine in your reviews rather than attempting to manipulate the system for personal gainIssues with chrome castingI did not believe such a good feature would be available at this price I liked the feature of supporting the Ethernet port and earphone jackKodak tvFor the amount being charged this is a acceptable TVThe Kodak XPRO model is same as Thomson A seriesDespite being big this was lighter than my previous Bravia TV and easily mounted to the previous wallmount Note The wall mount holes are plasticky and dont have any metal insertThe remote sensor is separate module projecting from the underside of the TV and does not look integrated with the main bodyThe two USB ports are side by side which dont interfere with each otherThe Audio out port is a good feature if one wants to watch TV without disturbing othersWhen i first connected the TV to my settop box over HDMI there was only picture and no soundThe person at the service center whose number is listed on the TVs warranty card said that they dont support this and i need to call the TV manufacturer so much for printing a service center number on warranty cardThis was fixed after changing the HDMI CEC settings in the settop box not TVs faultThere is no usermanual given with the TV most people based on their experience with phone should be able to ultimately figure out the connections The only included leafletbook whose pages were all stuck together talks about the Android menu There is no info on the TVs input jacks like what the HDMI ARC stands forI got multiple calls after the purchase to enquire about delivery and if i needed installationAs i already had a previous wall mount on which this could get attached with no hassles I opted out of installation serviceAll is welllllGood tvPicture quality is very good,4.2,B08CS3BT4L,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,4,5,8,409.170.984.455.958
"Really a Good Buy in this price range in 2022,Expected better Battery,Over-all a very balanced product.,Poor Battery life,Good,Temper glasses not istalle properly,It's 8 gb not working like 12gb,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.",Verdict A Solid buy for this price segment in and even for early There are reviews in this section Review is days after purchase Typos in the Review has rectified now and Review is days post Android beta update These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on August Before OOS update G only for Jio was enabled via another update G is still not available in my region Hence G related parameters are not covered in this reviewReview After about days of Oxygen OS Beta update Android Update received on Dec Note After the beta update no new issues popped upie there wereNo Heating related issuesNo fast battery drainNo change in the Charging timeNo annoying bugsNo change in camera performanceBeta update is mostly like a Stable updateOOS Android update reviewDelighters No new apps added Absolutely NOT System storage consumption remains the same GB Animations are more fluidic More customization UI features added Scout widgets in home screen Enlarged folder lot more Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor Ability to play videos in the background screen OFF as well even for YouTube Really a welcoming longing feature which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF Standby battery life has improved substantiallyDisappointers Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before No improvement in Sound levels Still initial is too silent No Dolby Atomos which was mentioned for OOS Perhaps to wait for Stable update Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier Response time is tad increased Haptics have become tighter than earlier but still not strongerReview Verdict A Good Buy in this price range in Note This review is after a months usage Received updates during the course of time Recent update was of GB System consumes GB space GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage N band is missing for G The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue Shifting from a Hz to this Hz mobile No noticeable difference observed In Nongaming aspect Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parametersThings that are delighting Exceptional signal reception especially G carrier aggregation Very fast download speeds Insane Fast charging to in mins to in mins excluding trickle charge No heating of the mobile just slight warming during charging Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic Even more than hrs for Videos YT and general tasks and calls even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver Oxygen OS Color OSRealme OS Bloatware The skin is really good nothing to complain like other brands UI Absolutely no rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any nd party apps Even some nd party apps are uninstallable No major bothering bugs noticed till date Yes the Alert slider is included unlike some premium OnePlus modelsThings that are annoying Dual ambient light sensor in rear and other in front is not well calibrated The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required Volume level is useless until level can be audible only in Pindrop silence ambience Audible enough only post level Stereo speakers output are bottom and earpiece But full volume doesnt distort is loud enough Haptics are tight but not strong even in higher levels Effective only post and best only level Hotspot drains battery quickly even a warning notification pops up Also Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm Though the inhand feel is good the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel The inbuild DAC no mm hole and only TypeC port is not great The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output Perhaps Dolby Atmos support in OOS could improve the audio outputOverall its a good mobile phone The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long Not much i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about hours on normal use not many themes available Samsung is better in that sense there are many wallpapers and themes available Display is clear and camera is also good Overall okayI got this mobile Gb Gb Ram variantat k after k discount on icici credit cardFor this price its a must buyI am using this product since last weeksThe camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very wellThe only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better as a working professional it doesnt makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a dayIf you have no issues with the battery section then just go for itBattery drains like any thing Rest all goodI have to recharge twice a day dont buy if you want a good battery backupEven though phone is fast charge I am disappointed with battery lifeI bought gb and and its working very smoothly for normal regular use you can go for itThere is problem with temper glass part front Cemera area temper glass not installingGood but not so fast as I think gb its ordinary like gb Apart from battery and sound quality

"Good,Does the job. Works with two devices,Positive review- Almost good and useful,Hissing sound  output from (viSe TV) Vijay sales.,Acceptable sound, no hassle of charging,Excellent product,Not good range,Very good",Atlast I connected successfully Working good But sound volume clarity not adequate Durability to be assessed Dear amazonin tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearlyManual printing also is bad I had to struggleDoes what it says Works well to connect two Bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop smart TV etc Can take a bit of time to pair two devices But the manual in the box helpsSound quality over aux cable too is good So even if you do not have a digital output or RCA you can still use it Bit bit flimsy and delicate But then you dont need to move it around everydayDisadvantage the sound and video lag with distance while connecting Bluetooth with headphonesPairing with headphones difficult need to wait longFeels volumes lowI got this to addon to a highend system which traditionally doesnt have the facility However its often requested when guests come over I was using a Phoenix transreceiver but the constant need of charging and the single indicator LED made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application The optical out is connected to a dual ESS DAC and the device used for transmission is the iPad AirThis lacks a battery which is a big differentiator This means it is not exactly portable and the form factor reinforces that feature It is intended to be a desktop unit and it comes with a reasonable set of cables The quality of the included cables is quite poor so its best to use something elseCompared to the direct input from USB the overall sound is poorer with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble Still this is being used in a highend system I suspect with many lesser speakerampDACs it will be acceptable At maximum output the level is about dB lower than a direct USB connection to the DACIt is around the same as my Signature Acoustics unit which is rd the size but uses a battery and doesnt have a volume control or the bypass feature or the nice display which is handy if you are close byThe bypass is one of the highlights of this device it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough and allows you to use both BT and another optical sourcereceiver though only either can be used at a timeThe build quality is average It is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards hence the thin cables supplied The onboard volume control is nice if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume I use the DAC remote It also has only clicks so the control will be very coarse The display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low it is sufficient for the tasksOverall its quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices The sound quality limitations of BT transmission compulsory resampling and lossy compression among others cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols so Id rank it close to the top of what you can get as an addon for a hifi system For more normal usage there are cheaper options availableExcellent productBluetooth range is very lessBought it to connect my old Sony blueray home theater with MI k box which does not have Optical sound port It has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in,4,B0978V2CP6,1,0,1,1,2,0,6,5,5,8,409.170.984.455.958

"Better than I expected!,Good,Good product,Great durability and original products,Very Nice !,Good product,Good,Good product",Pros Looking at the picture I thought it would just be the blender with some cap to cover the blade Turns out the cap was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything The container itself seems of great quality has measurements on the side and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when youre using the blender There is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall The blender itself is amazing to hold looks great and is pretty easy to use The blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else If you place it vertically you can leave it as it isCons After over seconds of continuous blending that is if Im not just pulsing it but continuously blending there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender Im not sure if thats a sign of overheating or if its normal Theres this groove right above the blade and every time Im done washing theres always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after Im done washing and I always have to go back to clean that So thats a small inconvenienceBut its overall great and Id highly recommend getting this productGoodMaking the life easyGreat durability and original productsVery nice product for small or moderate usageGood productVery goodVery useful product in day to day work,4.2,B0085W2MUQ,1,0,1,1,5,0,9,5,5,14,409.170.984.455.958
"A perfect balance of price and performance,Great Suction and above average mopping | Good Buy",Very happy with the product performanceInstallation Very easy to start using Had to wait for days for the technician but with the instructions from box you can start yourself without waitingIn the box disposable mops washable mops side brushes main brush Mopping plate Deebot Dust chamber with HEPA filter Charging Dock Cable User Manual Cleaning BrushCleaning performance Superb cleaning with power options Quiet Normal Max and Max Lower suction means lower battery consumption With higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up Good if you have children in the house Higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently In all the power options the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust The higher options are for deep cleaning Also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny placesCleaning Pattern st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a northsouth or eastwest cleaning pattern inside the edges No specific patterns like Y or SpiralMopping Performance The mopping also has electronically controlled water usage Low Medium High Ultra High The app shows warnings when using High and Ultra High The robot may slip due to water on the floor but I have been using High water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such a problem The wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings The mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad As it gets older more area will touch the floor than a new mopping pad For the st week the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better resultsCorner Cleaning cms of wall corners may not be cleaned esp if you dont have straight walls Eg if you have a bathroom door which has a cm cutout in the wall then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned degree wall corners may have a cm area which is not cleaned however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners All other areas with obstacles such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned Deebot may run around them or timesCorner Mopping As the Deebots mop is round it will not reach the corners expect a cm area in the degree wall corners not being mopped However on straight walls the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss cms which however will be cleaned by side brushesIMPORTANT If you have black furniture Black stone wall tiles mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where Deebots Top mounted laser is located the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by Deebot The laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall This is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effectiveMapping The st run will map the entire house and you need to follow Deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed Subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles eg chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped The N version does not have additional sensors as the pro version So it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see Also you can save at maximum of maps at a time floors The st run will be a very random cleaning pattern After the st run you can edit the rooms Divide or merge areas and rename the rooms based on some preset options like Living room bed room kitchen etc Once the rooms are mapped Deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning patternThe created maps are not editable you cannot move or adjust boundaries You have option to add virtual boundaries as a line or as a rectangle box where the robot should not go This is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of Deebot Deebots laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go behind the mirror So you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box Deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them if you have installed mopping plate then Deebot will ignore carpet area Also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas Similar to Virtual boundaryApplication Use I used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions The app has an advanced mode which works as per the stored map If you turn it off Deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it Eg I have a balcony which cant be accessed by the Deebot directly I can pickup and place it in the balcony turn advanced mode off and start cleaning Once it is done it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessibleThe app also has cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on Area cleaning Select a room or multiple rooms to clean Auto clean Clean the entire house Custom Cleaning Select an area on the map to cleanYou can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms You can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room or can use a common setting for the entire house You can also preset how many times Options are once or twice you want to clean a specific room You can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day Deebot will start working automatically However this is not advisable if you are mopping As per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use If any water leaks onto the parts it may void warrantyThere is an option to auto boost suction on carpets to Max You can set the option for continuous cleaning ie whether you want Deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway Deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area resume the cleaning and then return to recharge this saves timeThe app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time It is an Ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories Side Brush Main Brush HEPA Filter This area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images which is really helpfulThe app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps This helps to check if any areas were not cleanedCleaning and Maintenance Expect that instead of cleaning the house daily you will be washing the mopping pad every day and Cleaning Deebot once every week depending on the size of your house Cleaning will take around to minutes remove all hairs from side brush main brush and wheels remove the dust chamber remove the HEPA filter and wash the dust chamber Wash the main and side brushes if needed Clean all the sensors of Deebot with a dry cloth Let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them Also remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost You will need to replace the accessories every months based on the usage and maintenance Consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuumOverall Rating The cleaning and mopping performance is very good and better than a house maid in most circumstances Eg Deebot goes under the sofas Expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle and cleaning areas out of reach of Deebot In this price range I am very satisfied with the performance,4.4,B0B19VJXQZ,1,0,1,1,1,0,9,5,5,10,409.170.984.455.958

"Received defective phone and running from one customer care to another to replace the phone,Honest opinion.,Worth the money but not as good as promised,Good budget model phone,value for money.,Galaxy m53,Good buy for 22k,A little overpriced but gets the work done",Below is the experience so far Received a defective product Battery was getting drained out in few hours wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble including Google maps Location was not getting captured Tried to return it on the th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open tried on th night as well but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile Amazon app was in this phone Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile Amazon said return window is closed on th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely couldnt identify the issue Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue First visit to center they did a software update week old phone now not sure what update would be pending and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone Faced issues the very same evening lived with it for one more day and went back next morning Second visit they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesnt allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery which was defective They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they dont have the authority for that Called customer care number again and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the sellerSo back to step Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end If I manage to reach thereUpdate All customer care said they cant replace the phone So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced Again whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist battery was draining out by the minute I showed it to them They told me its a new battery and will take some time to stabilize They also asked me to buy a super fast charger while i bought from them to not take chances They asked me to check for days and confirm Used for days Same situation No improvement Went back to them again They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests They kept the phone for days and returned saying everything is fixed Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund They refused with all their might and said phone is working now During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for days I officially registered a complaint But still no luck of returning the phoneUpdate on Nov th I was traveling and outside the country On Nov st while using the phone and with charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from s Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times No luck Still grid lines My flight bookings hotel bookings and everything one can think of was in the mobile and my month old phone is not responding to anything possible Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center Nov th Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center They mentioned patch issue Software update dint happen At this point I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation No month old phones screen will stop responding because of software update missing They are opening the phone again to operate it after again refusing my request for money refundIts really good smartphone in its range packed with features And brand like Samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point I still give it a stars as battery could be better It also looses a point for not including a chargerPhone looks are good The charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger W original Also camera quality is not even like MP total lied about MP Samsung UI is not very friendly and easy Other brands have better and smoother UIPhone is very sleek bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is Good budget model phoneyou can not deny brand sumsung is a brand overall good product for long useGood worckCharger should have been part of it But product looks goodPricewise a little overpricedSome of the cons are a little rigid fingerprint sensor after months of use i frequently encounter a lag when unlocking the phone battery life not up to the mark struggles to go the entire day even with regular use no mm jack and a buggy BTPros a very good camera excellent screen superb sound qualityIf you somehow get this for below k then go for it or else there are better options available,3.9,B09XJ5LD6L,1,1,1,1,2,1,8,5,6,10,409.170.984.455.958

"Sufficient for a Family,Makes superior coffee,almost par with those brewed in CCD,value for money,Nice,Doesn’t justify the Description,Good for the price,Unnecessary Buy,Delivery without Warranty Card",This machine can easily brew coffee for a family of members at a time Some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe The answer is simple NO Reason is that this isnt a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewerNow my experience with this machine was good And a bad thing was that I did not get the steam pipe sleeve Except that everything was well packed When you buy this machine make sure to rinse the internal passage throw the first water from the machine thoroughly wash the caraffe puck filter and measurement spoon Remember to NEVER USE dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe puck or anything such It may ruin the coffee aromaMethod efficient as per my opinion Fill the water in tank No need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector Dont run it dry It may damage the heating element or pump Switch ON the machine After that pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter level it and press it to compress I use ratio spoon of coffee powder to spoon of water at output Before changing over to drip mode open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built Placing carafe under the puck slowly move the selector till Europa and quickly back it to steam icon This will let the coffee bloom inside After seconds slowly move the selector upto Espresso The decoction should be not too slow or not too runny Wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode Take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk Place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus Slowly open the steam valve located at the side Steam it as per your need Mix the milk and decoction Thats itRemember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside Open the steam valve and let all the pressure get releasedCoffee used Bombay Island Espresso grind Medium Roast Use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind Dont use Aeropress V or any other grind as it may not produce desired tasteI personally like this machine For the price its good and build quality is Moderate Please watch some YouTube videos if you are new to coffee machines Its very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge You may also watch James Hoffmann He is World Barista Champion and shares tips about coffeeIm a fan of espresso Every time I go to a coffee joint I tend to order a doppio A double shot espresso But those prices are way too high if I wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday So Ive decided to buy this machine One thing to say the quality and durability depends on the user If you take care the machine would take care of your cup of joeSo how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing Always rinse the drip tray Use dish washing liquid with water to clean the carafe Do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds Run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds This is crucial because dents can affect quality Before and after your brewing activities make sure that you clean the internals To do this fill the carafe till the mark with bottled water Assemble an empty permafilter Switch on and set the strength to max In about a minute you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe Check its color If its yellow then rinse and repeat If it is white dry everything and switch it off Then either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day Always let the steam out When you froth milk immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothWARNING NEVER EVER USE HARDTAP WATER IT CAUSES SERIOUS LIMESCALING ISSUES WHICH CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE TASTE QUALITY OF YOUR COFFEE IT MAY ALSO CAUSE DIGESTIVE ISSUES ALWAYS USE SOFTCAN WATERTHE WATER MUST NOT TASTE SALTY OR SWEET TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY PLEASE DO NOT POST MISLEADING REVIEWS STATING THAT MY MACHINE BROKETHE STEAM KNOB IS THE WORST PART OF THIS MACHINE THE MACHINE WAS USED JUST FOR DAYS THEN THE STEAM KNOB DECIDED TO LOOSEN UP AND FALL OFF I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT THERE THE PROBLEM IS IM JUST AND I CANT DRIVE AND THE SERVICE CENTER IS FAR AWAY SO I REMOVED THE RUBBER CASKET AND FIXED THE KNOB DIRECTLY IT COMES OFF BUT I THINK ILL USE IT ONLY TO EASE THE PRESSURE BECAUSE I ALWAYS DRINK IT BLACK BUT THIS ISSUE MAKES ME REDUCE A STARTips for using the machine Use fine grounded coffee I use Narasus PB or Royal Elite Bold Currently Im using Phalada Pure Sure Organic Coffee Powder For the best results you must grind the coffee on your own If you cant make sure the coffee is fresh Mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster both for the machine and your stomach respectively You can also go for Lavazza But it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the Mariana Trench Only use good quality bottledcan water Maintain a good cleaning discipline In case youve used hardtap water immediately do a descaling Refer your instruction manual Always tamp your ground in the filter You must apply about pounds of force This is about kg of force Hold the force for about seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it Make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisAs you can see this is a real espresso maker It produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee For me it produced about mm crema for a double shot This is good for a steam driven machine Note that this is a steam driven machine You can never get the finish of coffee joints because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps Although the tastes would be similar provided you use the correct beansPlease look at the pics to see the finish The cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old The brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder Ive just bought Can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness This applies even to taste The white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth The brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best leaving a crisp and nutty taste Also after I did some research I came to know that an espresso must have three layers A bitter crema a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom You must mix these before drinking to have the best shot If you see the glass picture Ive attached you can clearly see those layersOVERALL THIS IS A GREAT ESPRESSO MACHINE FOR A BEGINNER IT MAKES GREAT ESPRESSO AND IT IS ECONOMICAL TOO AS I SAID IF YOU TREAT THE MACHINE WELL THE MACHINE WOULD TREAT YOUR CUP OF JOE WELLBeing a coffee enthusiast the product fits in my requirementEasy to use Time taken is reasonable Adjustment of intensity works wellFrothing tool is very good though i prefer black coffee frothing helps getting a perfect creamy coffee for my guestsNice productThe coffee strength nob is a mythBut itne paise me itna is goodVery happy with the machine works fine and easy to operate unfortunately it wasnt packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken everything was packed in the

"A seamless printing experience, with scope for improvements in set up,Good One,Very user friendly when compare with others,Best for home use,Good for home use,good printer,Good,Good for occasional printing. Extremely easy to use",I bought this item in August and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as Ive come to expect from Amazon Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct supportThe only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didnt actually lead to much of a guide rather a boilerplate page I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever I must have removed and reinserted them almost times before they were properly detected No error messages showed up and I didnt know if I had recieved a faulty product or if I was doing something wrong Never having owned a printer and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray leading to a jam at the first print itself Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets clearer access to the online guide mightve helped hereExcept for the these minor concerns in setup Im enjoying using this printer surprisingly since printers alongside projectors are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry Ive used all the features so far print colored double sided scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality wifi or the cartridges Information on the number of color and blackandwhite sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when I run outgood scanner printerInstallation procedure is very simple and priter quality is high I had a Xerox copier but istallation of scanner option could not completeIf you are purchasing it for your home use dont look any further It has got all the functions youll find in a k worth printers All in one includes print scan copy and fax as well Colour adf duplex printing wifi You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself Only two issue that I faced firstly the print qualitywhich Ill speak to the service center and secondly is the total quantity of color prints I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is I guess Ill have to purchase a larger cartridgeVery good printer Sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage But overall very happygud printer but printing cost is expensive in this price range features are very niceI got this printer ion Nov After days of usage Im unable to print as it is showing Color black ink is low i have print less than pages and in description they told that pages yield which is totally wrongCannon EThis was launched as a successor for E I searched everywhere but couldnt find a credible source to explain the differences between the two I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me wifi enabled so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop clear color print decent for childs homework photo quality not required and cheap to run E seem to fit all the criteria so I ordered this Even the canon authorised showroom didnt have E in stock so ordered the E off AmazonSummary fullfills top two criteria Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional printDelivery was days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon so that was great It was just the printer box with no outer packing The box was sealed with cello tape and not sealed so I suspect it had been opened at some point Thankfully all the components were there and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact so i was ok with the deliverySetup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi I never had to use the usb cable Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website link for both given in manual which guides step by step on how to setup I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devicesColor prints are a bit faded on plain paper gsm This might be a function of the paper and not the printer The blackwhite prints are crisp and sharp The print speed is decentThe only negative is the amount of ink consumption While the box says color prints and bw both my cartridges are showing at after color print and around bw Specially for color prints the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just prints I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that full color pages Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option but it is messy and requires practice This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarelyA special mention for the ADF and duplex printing Both the features are extremely useful Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range and comes in very handy while printing larger documentsOverall I am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage I will update the review if I run into any issues,3.8,B09F5Z694W,1,0,1,1,5,0,9,6,6,14,409.170.984.455.958

"NOt worth the money,Good budget smart watch with Alexa,👍,Good product,I don't have flashlight function and speaker is not working,Nice,It's little cost,Wach not working",Review OverviewAverageThe Boat today launched the Boat Xtend the companys latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of Rs The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch Moreover it has builtin Amazon Alexa support SpO tracking stress tracking and much more Coming in a budget segment is it worth it Should you buy this smartwatch If you too have such queries then there is nothing to worry about It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about itContentsBox ContentDesign Build ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy NowBox ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in blackgold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign Build ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch one always thinks about its design and look Apart from features design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look The design is inspired by the Apple Watch but it cannot be compared to that Obviously in every aspect Apple Watch would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design but the build quality is much premium on this oneBoat Xtend design and buildI personally dont like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame I believe the gold color would fade away after some time There are three other color variants which also dont look stylish as this one However that is my personal opinion on the color scheme so maybe you might find the color scheme to be goodBoat Xtend designThe watch has ATM water resistance It has silicon straps which are quite comfortable The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usageDisplayComing to the display the watch has a mm square shape display What you see on this one is a TFT panel The screen has big bezels however the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off so you wont notice the bezels and the screen quality wont feel cheap at all It doesnt have an alwayson display but we cannot complain about that The watch offers a screen on time of up to seconds and up to levels of brightness controlBoat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat View angle is good on this one and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight The color on this one is not very saturated but this isnt something that we can complain about in this price rangeWatch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use There is a single button on the watch which works as the poweroff button as well as the back button Moreover the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem There isnt much animation on the bar menu and the navigation is simple so you wont find it difficult to use However the watch may lag a bit The company has done costcutting in terms of the processor thats why you may find it to lag a bit but it is OK and not a big deal at the price point you get itBoat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity which includes total steps walked calories burnt and time heart rate sleep tracking stress tracking breath training SpO training meditation find my phone and music control Apart from that there are different support modes on this watch I tried a few of them and they worked fine The watch notifies you of the incoming calls messages received and various other notifications in detailBoat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support The watch has an inbuilt microphone and you can access it by longpressing the back button Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm setting a timer and such Well it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch but you wont find it very useful Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement and then you wont prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks So even if Boat missed this feature it wont be a problemBoat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one You get more than watch faces on the watch and probably more watch faces will be added to it Moreover you can also set a custom watch face as wellBoat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices You wont be seeing bugs on the app and it works perfectly I havent noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple You will get all the fitnessrelated options and all the watch settings on the app itselfBoat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch So talking about the accuracy I tested everything on this watch from normal walking to running sleeping and much more and I find the results to be accurateBoat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch the result was the same on all of them So there is no problem with the accuracy I dont find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers but yes this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking sleep tracking and everything it doesBoat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently the stress level as well as the SpO tracking is much more accurate on this one It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in womenBoat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a mAH battery on this one which the company claims to last days However if you use most of the features of the watch then the battery will last about two and a half days If you keep the brightness low then the battery will last about days I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch It comes with magnet hook charging supportFinal WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker a good display Alexa support good design and build and much more The smartwatch at this price is quite good Personally what I didnt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme However if you like the color scheme then I would recommend you to go for it Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life The battery life on this one is quite low The company claims it to have a battery life of days but with regular usage it will last for days If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs and you can adjust with the battery life and you like the color scheme then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under RsPros Premium build quality with matte finishing sturdy polycarbonate frame good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch Attractive trendy colours Heart Rate except heart rate spikes in weight training Pedometersteps counter are accurate but SPO is off by when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings But most smart watches offer the same accuracy Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time wake up time duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate Light deep sleep waking detected but no REM sleep detected Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces Large clear bright sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun Touch not smooth experienced jitters UI also lags at times after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require taps to work But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically In app GPS works superbly Excellent route tracking on the map This feature is not advertised in their description Bluetooth connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximitym The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times Definitely splash proof though didnt take the risk of submerging the watch All notifications are working no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications No lags at all though there is provision for a sec lag which can be turned on Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker info is displayed on the screen My Wipro Smart Bulb FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch Alexa can do mathematical calculations currency conversions even foreign language translations apart from supplying info on anything under the sun But ofcourse Alexa cannot make calls Alexa can set alarm timer also Sedentary alert drinking water reminder stress alert menstrual cycle alert alarms timers function well Boat Wave app connects easily no lags observed Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective Training Sports modes r good Guided Breathing mode is also good Find my phone works well Extremely stylish light weight comfortable for all day wear watch faces available in the device with preset which cannot be deleted The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave appCons Lacks vibration intensity control Lacks Camera control shutter But cant figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands gestures to click pics No quick reply messages for notificationscall alerts No call acceptance or silencing feature A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time SPO is not accurate and sometimes freezes at But this is common in all smart watches Battery doesnt last more than days if continuous HR measurement is turned on Otherwise easily lasts for days Watch faces are very childish Expected better quality designs Company can easily improve on this in their next update Amazon Prime only replacement no refund policy is not good At least colour change should be allowed once Music control feature does not display the title of the song No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data No calling feature But it doesnt matter as most dont want conversations to be public A bit large for narrow wrists band mm is a bit wide Company should provide a tempered glass protector No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately There are actually only sports modes Boat has bloated the list with IndoorOutdoor combi of sports Walking Running Swimming Cycling There is no light sensor Auto brightness is only time dependant but works wellWas a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour the evergreen classic goldblack Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in available at the budget price point of under Rs An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health MonitorPlz add calling feature with thisOtherwise it is okGoodIts little expensive but okkk,4.1,B096VF5YYF,1,1,1,1,2,1,14,6,7,16,409.170.984.455.958

"Product as describe,Good product,Good product but price high.,I miss my gas stove.... Induction sucks :(,Great value,No1,तेल गर्म करने में परेशानी,Good",I recvd product within dys while owing to rural area other product tks dys to deliver n product recvd at gd condition n works well aftr use if smthng cms up will review againIt works good Nice heating But hard to clean as it has ridges and small gap between the hot plate and the controls and also below the plate edges Other than that fine product se jyada price nahi hona chahiye tha Use karne mein bahut achha haiOver all Im really disappointed by the product and especially cooking experience I was used to normal gas and it was easy to regulate to propper temperature This product has only like temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle For example when I set C then it is burning toasts and onions When I set one step lower it is C and it is not enough for frying Also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware And even when I invest to expensive Tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges You can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside The pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so Im sure the fault is in this philips stove You can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom Also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed And even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse Onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside Im really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stoveThere is one positive side and that is that heating is quick My pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly Faster than on gas stove Also you can set time for like minut and leave it which is quite convenientControll is easy But I hate details First I love one detail There is pause button which is very cool If something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat It is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off light up again and then find right flame again Here you just press pause again and cook as before But that is only thing that I love Otherwise I hate how it is designed First basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless Those buttons are preset temperatures But anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook Like there is stirr fry button and it set C It totally burns onion I set usually C for beginning and then soon change for C But even C is too much burning But lower setting is only C which is not frying at all I would need like C I guess and it is impossible to set Also I noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses It heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like seconds starts again So instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and offBut back to controll Except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it wont let you or let you to do only one but not times Why I dont know probably ill will You need to first press manual button which change temperature completely to C and only then you can freely press and set your desired temperature So basically I never use any preset mode and I always only press manual and to set my temperatureAnother control is setting time I must say satting time is useful feature and I love it but how it is implemented I hate When you press time button then by default it set minutes Ok but when you hold button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to and roll to hours Holding incrementdecrement is so quick that it is useless It must have implement some idiot Anyway you can always click one by one So to set minutes you must click time button and then click times minus button to set minutes It is doable but pretty annoying Or I long press it usially jumps directly to hours and then I press times Still anoying but I save like clicks What is super idiotic is that when I want to add minutes I click time and it by default set minutes again Arrrrggghhhhh So instead of just click time and times I need to click times Really this must have done some idiot Another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not Imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like seconds and not pressing and then after those seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again When controlling stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry So over all I would buy anything else next time Maybe it will be worse but I would at least tryAnyway to say something positive at the end I like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good Packaging was also well But power cable is only like meters That might be too short But for me just enough Also I like mechanic buttons some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but I like to feel the press and the click Buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them Cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat Cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stoveProduct is good but service center problem not available nearlyNoतल गरम करन म परशनOrdered one was faulty,4.2,B00EDJJ7FS,1,0,1,1,4,0,15,6,6,19,409.170.984.455.958

"A conditional beast,Overall satisfied but Wow factor is no missing,Honest one which might help.,Perfect one , You can buy",Liked Top notch display gorgeous display heavyly and seriously powerful device thanks to gen Tremendous battery life in heavy usage Super cool device Silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance good sound quality The form factor is really good I mean the screen is flat so it feels like a widenot actually wide but feels like phone also it is tall thats why it really feels good at hand I have an iPad but all the work now can be done by phone so I am happyDidnt like it As I had opt i loved oxygen os but now it feels like realme UI Camera is worst for this price Main sensor is good other two are useless Company should provide a telephoto lens in this price range I had opt and previously optboth camera were good Opt camera is exactly same as nord tConclusion if you looking for speed performance battery life longevity best of display premium feel then go for itIf you are looking for OP experience like an alert slider or a good camera then please dont choose this Either u can wait for the next OP or go for other devices if you dont bother about UI experienceie oxygen then go for iqootits far better in specgo to gsmarena compare opr and opt exactly same specification except processor and charging speedthis much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec I am OnePlus user since their st phone I have used OnePlus OnePlus Nord Nord CE Nord T and now T I have been using T as my primary phone since last month Everytime OnePlus never fails to impress with their new phone but this time you would feel something is missing may be because OnePlus has already raised their bar so much that user always expect more from them When I saw T first time somewhere in my subconscious mind I had taken my decision to buy this beast But before I reviewed so may phones from One Nord to iPhone My ratings Design and build Camera quality Battery backup and charging time Performance Undoubtedly design and build is unmatched So sturdy and beautiful Camera quality might be discussion point They should have given more in camera because phone comes in high range and premium level but current camera is not so bad Noone can beat its battery charging time and backup time Within min to highly impressive It will survive around day for average user Performance is good installed and ran multiple apps at a time never faced any hung issue or app carsh issueAs I said even if wow factor is missing this time I would say good phone with nice overall performance design and features If you get it in sale around k its a good deal Go for it nothing to regret Purchased it some days ago Switched from my Asus so I had really high expectations and well it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well Im just gonna list as pros and cons Pros I mean snapdragon Gen you can expect amazing performance why not top tier since its the best processor android could offer Well cause I feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but its holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff Build Quality is actually good Especially the back the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone expect for the frame ofc its made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later Software Im not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo I feel its fast and a good ui of course some old features not available now since Ive used a OnePlus in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os just hope its not completely turned to color os Charging is just insanity on this one switching from a phone which used to take around hours to get fully charged to this one almost finishing full charge under minutes and Ive witnessed it several times its just impressive but some issues and Ill talk about it in cons Networking and connecting is fast and good Havent faced any major issues in my networking experiences calling is a good experience connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast good overallCons about the processor like I said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit although I dont care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good Polycarbonate frame and No alert slider Like really at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit not really a big fan of alert slider so I didnt mind that part the camera setup is so so so average and stupid aside from the main lens the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment this is literally the same setup from Nord T but just a better software optimisation front camera is alright too nothing that great Charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup usually in my usage I have to charge it times for it to be used the whole day it drains a bit more than I expected it to also theres no option available to disable W charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery only except for the night optimisation mode which is kind of good in my opinionPhone is a good segment in this price range and If you do believe in the particular brand image and its products then go for it Although Iqoo T does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance but this device does the job tooSo basically I am reviewing it after usage of month and days I am giving it star because of Alert slider missing Lets me clear it by points Battery is awesome It will get full charge in minutes seconds It lasts more than hours to me Camera quality is nice Specially night mode is awesome Some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture No lagging no hang It runs smoothly and very fast Only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone Video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable While watching any OTT streaming quality is awesome You can fully enjoy it Speaker of phone is perfect even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call,4.3,B0B5V47VK4,1,0,1,1,1,0,21,7,7,22,409.170.984.455.958
"Really good for the price [6/8 months update], but with a late appearing issue,After 2 months,Right bud is not performing well,Good value for money!,Working as expected,Best at price,Good built quality, functions need improvement,Product is good but battery not as expected",Update after monthsUpdate The problem mentioned in the earliest review is becoming more and more dire with time Now right earbud gets discharged in hour and a half whereas left one keeps going so reducing one star Will contact them for replacement and update hereUpdate Called service center they asked to bring it but am lazy I expected theyd replace at home Paid more attention towards the issue above The stable situation is that just after full charge right bud can go upto hrs but left one always goes for mins more and the difference is more if there is a standby of a day or two when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems so I guess I can still use the buds but with certain restrictions Will happily restore stars if the issue stays stable for next monthsUpdate after monthsNo change in quality still the pack charges the buds like a boss During this period they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour very dangerous thankfully he couldnt swallow them full of saliva and whatnot and on another occasion I threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force undisclosed depressing reason due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached which I then reattached After all this buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day I think these are pretty darn sweet deals Lack of volume control etc etc is all forgiven Happy customer Although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persistsOriginal reviewUsing for last monthsI am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist But I hadnt used any tws yet so wanted to dip my toes and didnt want to invest much but also not something throwaway So settled for boult no boat etc due to their highly adultered sound signature since I have previous experience with it I like my music flat at studio quality More recently Ive been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance oneodio pro Go ahead and search it It is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fansComing to this twsConnectivity Right out of the box only left one was working after connecting to my iphone Maybe right one didnt pair correctly to left Did that reset thing as suggested which also took some effort but after that both started working and since then no issues I am using both my phone and laptop linux Ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another But perfect connectivity now I can move around in my sqft apt and no connection loss which is greatCall quality is decent faced no disconnects yet and the other party is also ok with my voice but you cannot talk in a hushed voice you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand youFeatures Tapping is oddly sensitive I mean it responds even if I am adjusting the bud and not touching the central area but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to playpause I can get used to that though One thing track aage peeche is ok But these dont have anything which can control the volume Bummed on thatBattery Decent backup Its been nearly months I use buds on an average of hours daily and I just had to charge the main case just times In an emergency I also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly I was happy to see that One weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left infact I can use the left one mins more that the right But anyways I put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low batterySound qualityBass frequencies Very decent bass Surprisingly great low bass songs like the humma song i wanna love you sound pretty good but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass lut gaye by Jubin doesnt sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature Overall for the most part you should be fineOther frequencies Ill review this from vantage point of studio quality signature For mids the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above but its bearable For highs initially I felt the presence a bit lacking which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks but after using it for a few days I started feeling alright in that aspect maybe some burn in God knows Also remembering that I paid just bucks for these I mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions so I think my mind wont be nitpicking then Ill soon be upgrading thoughOverall really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under k CheersHey This one item has a built quality is like a stoneand also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice thats the only disadvantage on this oneRight buds not performs well I am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manualBeen using these for a month now Cant massively complain the sound quality is decent enough may not be good enough for big music heads not enough bass and provides good noise isolation Very impressed by the battery life with the charging case and I use it every day If you can snag it on a deal for bucks its a fantastic dealMy only issue is we cant change the connection to devices by click Every thing else is fineBest at price and require some button for operationcall pick up rejection function next song play function not working on single touchProduct is good but battery not as

system that creates a transparent sound and metal sound chambers created via a step process Marketing fluff aside how do the earphones really sound Simply put surprisingly decent for earphones that cost less than a nice dinner for twoWhile most earphones in this price range have overinflated bass that dominates the rest of the frequency range the bass response on the Mi Earphones is controlled and restrained It doesnt overwhelm the sound signature or smother the highs That said bassheads will be left slightly wantingIts surprising to hear that highs are present and distinct in the sound mix although they do get overpowering sometimes The mids are slightly repressed which is evident in vocalheavy genres such as blues While the clarity on offer is decent for the price songs with many layers of instrumentation do sound muffled and noisy This is most evident in complex genres such as rock and metal in which the earphones sound harsh and the mids get buried by the treble and bassThis earphone set is fantastic And highly deserving of money I used it for a while last in and now Im buying it once more in In my perspective the Mi headset has good music and is easy to usegood goodNice productGentle bassNo loud soundProduct quality is decentDont expect heavy music experienceIts sometime uncomfortable but its fine i can adjustSeriously if you are a bass lover then you can go for itBut its built quality is not good it will damage automatically after monthsit is not suitable for rough usesGot it for less than rs Not disappointted at allIf you compare it with other brands like Boat the sound quality isnt as good as the contemporaries But for the price I paid Im not disappointed at allThe bass is solid Noise cancellation is average and the earphones are a little low on volume couldve been louderGood value for money product for earphones under Very Good product as expected,4.1,B07CD2BN46,1,0,1,1,3,0,14,7,7,17,409.170.984.455.958

"Serves unlimited hot water instantly,Very good,Go for it,Instant heating,Just go for it.,Best for instant heat water,Amazing products,Instant got water, quite literally",I bought Havells lts Instant Geyser KW WhiteBlue and Im really happy I made this decisionLet me start with why I went for Instant Geyser instead of Storage GeyserStorage geysers have a tank to store water and heat itFor example a litre storage geyser fills up the litre tank and then heats the waterAs it has to heat high volume lts of water it takes time of about to minutesInstant geysers on the other hand heat water instantly within to minutesHowever the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volumedepending on tank capacity of hot waterNow who should opt for Instant Geyser and who should opt for Storage Geyser is the question If you like to have a Shower Bath for which you require more than litres of hot water continously then you should go for Storage Geyser since storage geyser of capacity more than lts will store lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pausesInstead if we consider Instant Geyser of lts capacity for shower bath it cant provide you lts of hot water continously because for every lts it takes time to heat water againHence for a shower bath better to go for Storage GeysersIf you like to have a Bathtub Bath then instant geysers are good to go becauseConsider using a bathtub a bathtub generally is of capacity ltsIf you even use a Storage Geyser of high capacity as much as lts still you will have pauses of to minutes eachBecause at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for mins for the next lts to heatSo to fill the entire bath tub you need to have times lts of hot water ltsSo the total wait time would be times mins on an average minsIn this scenario of Bathtub bath its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every lts of hot water still the pauses being very small youll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heathotnessThen you might ask what should we consider for Bucket Bath Both Storage geysers of lts or above and Instant geysers of lts or above are good to goJust choose based on Price Time taken to heat instant takes less time Energy consumption instant comsumes less Now coming to Havells lts Instan Geyser of KW why I bought this Havells is a great brandI wanted to have it for Bathtub BathKW heats lts of water in just to secondsWhat I liked about this productI have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating lts of water in just seconds I have used a timer to note that The installation was totally free however remember you will be charged if there is any Plumbing Work do be doneNo need to buy any extra accesories like pipes everything is provided in the box you just need to buy a amp plug which would be less than rsAs soon as the product was delivered by amazon I got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done thanks a lot Havells This might differ for you based on your location I live in hyderabadI really like havells customer serviceThe geyser comes with years of warrenty for the whole and yrs of warrenty on the tankIt has Auto Cutoff feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats It shows color indication Blue when its heating and Orange when it has done heating Have a look at the pictures I have attachedNoteGo for the kw model if you want hot water instantly in to seconds the kw model might take to mins to heat lts of waterMake sure it is kw model because I see reviews from other customers who say the Mustard colored geyser is not kw but kw better go for white and blue color to be sure Very nice productGood productKW rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water Good productGreat product at great priceValue for money and instantly warm water comes in just minHavella water heaterWater heats up in secs depending on the weatherThis review is after using this water heater continuously for days in December in Kolkata with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at degree Celsius during afternoon early evening hours On the coldest day so far it took around min seconds to heat up completelyIf you dont have chronic pain or arthritis or this is not going to be used for very old people whereby really hot water is required for bathing I think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto degrees because I have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower not using a bucket and its manageableObviously cant be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser but this heats quite quickly so can be used in the shower even with the low capacityFor that same reason it can be used for multiple people because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters youll have fully hot water only of lesser quantity so if you dont live someplace cold or dont need very hot water but mildly hot water this can be used for multiple people as wellInstallation support was also goodNo cons only that if Havells introduces a l instant heater in the kW range then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesnt have their own home and might need to move around because its compact and provides instant hot water,4.2,B078JF6X9B,1,0,1,1,1,0,25,7,7,26,409.170.984.455.958
"[Updated] decent tws for under 1k,Sound clarity.,Good Product,Buds are very good Quality.,Nothing,Budget Friendly,Amazing sound,Good product...",Updated Overall you really get what you pay for They serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening Main problem I noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason Once or twice I had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it pairedIf you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesnt work This is starting to get annoying but maybe Ill get used to it Well seeThis is just day review of these Got them for Rs on some offer on Amazon Ill post updates later on Hope this is helpful for anyone interestedPackage The packaging is quite decent for such a low price Comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case Also included are a very short USB c cable and two additional earplugs small and large Package includes some Noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction cardBuild was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting Will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded The earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand They fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the caseComfort This is very subjective and each ear is different Its one of the reaonss I wanted to get a cheap tws to see if Im OK with the form factor for long hours The prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so I switched to the small size ones And after about mins I forgot I was even wearing them The earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they dont cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use One thing to note is that if you have Gandhi ears then the fit might be a little awkward I should know My ears covered the touch areas of the buds so I had to fiddle around a bit if I wanted to do any of the touch actions YMMVSound quality I liked them Im no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation I tried my usual test at and they fared quite well The treble maxes out at khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point There was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below hz but the L and R drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent I feel this definitely punches above its price pointCall quality In a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good There was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear But things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like youre inside a well Seems the mics cant figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality Overall you get what you pay for hereRange max I got was around m Not sure how they tested and got m as advertised Any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so I guess thats passablePairing UPDATE on th Aug Major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone You have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again Had issues like only one of the buds pairing as wellHave to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenientI dont have a phone to test the fast pair features Actually Im not even sure these support it Anyway the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and I was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones They will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices I could not find any way to control the pairing mode though You have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does They switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a littleBattery life Way too early to tell anything Will share my experience post one week and one month But they came around charged in the box and I have stated to charge the case Box says it will take hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done The earphones also have LEDs that blink red white to indicate pairing low battery etcSync issues None so far But have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the L and R earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price TWSes So will see if I face any such problemsThese are the primary areas that I am concerned with while evaluating any TWS so will share how my experience is after a while So far Im happy with themHi My name is AkshayI used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable moneygood in calling alsoeverything is perfectGood Sound QualityBuds are very good Quality With great noise cancellation featureWhen we received this order box is already opened like thisI was not expected at allwhat i dont like is the earpads sometime it came out dont know the reason even i tried different

"Not a disappointment, but can be better,IT IS NOT A BAD IDEA TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS SMART WATCH,Nice quality,Display is awsome,Sleep tracking",Original rd Jan This is my first smartwatch I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family but this is my personal first I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last months or so and Im aware of most of the products in the budget range While I can afford a slightly more expensive one GTSGTR or Honor GT Pro Oppo Watch Fitbit etc with calling feature I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa yet to be included but must be available through an OTA update Id have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro It still isnt released in IndiaComing to the watchs performance the typical features I tried today first day are Heart RATE HR SPO Stress monitoring and GPS I have a pulse oximeter from Dr Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO The numbers on the watch arent very accurate to my surprise heart rate variation by bpm and SPO percentage off by points at times But I still feel its more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house It wont surprise me if I dont get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone Music controls worked fine bluetooth data transfer or sync was good I couldnt control the phone camera as I couldnt get that feature to work refer to image and help me if you can I didnt face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications The readability on the watch screen has been really good Tried a couple of workouts While the step count seems to be fine not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modesTo conclude I wouldnt say that this watch is a disappointment but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats Probably I should give it more time but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy at least the Honor bands Ive seen Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as Im curious what all it can doI would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days Lets seeUpdate th Jan The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out Im hardly getting it for days with always on display and an occasional workout Limited watch faces both on device and the app Not many out of these do justice to the good display Waterproof nature of the device is good I didnt dip it in water but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action I got the camera shutter to work I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa Notifications didnt have an issue but could not clear individual items clear all workedREVIEW OF AMAZFIT GTS Mini Smart watch modelHello everyone Since the new model of amazfit GTS mini arrived i am going to review the old model of itProsDisplay inch amoled display really good look prosBattery coming with maH from percent to percent it takes days to drain and it was expected to last day longer normal use But If you are a light user it can last it for days ProIP rating IP water resistant which is cool ProHeartbeat sensor It has heartbeat sensor and it is real but it may not show real accuracy at all the time But it performs good proComfortness It is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material proWork out modes There are nearly workout modes and i tested out some since it is built in GPS it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well procan track stressHas PAI feature to progress your workout with better experienceAlexa assistant but need phone connection to activate this Has other modes like breathing menstrual cycle trackingtodolist inbuilt alarm pomodoro timer sleep tracker Timer In built compass camera remote find the phone controlling music etcNotification system you can get notifications Call control system You can accept or reject calls but you cannot able to talk through watchConsBuild quality it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium and half is poly carbonate con Watch faces the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good conSPO I dont know how much accurate it is but coming to technical part the sensors are failing most of the times Sometimes cannot able to sync workout history conVerdict It is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality The incoming call notification disconnects if youre away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch I have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors even though its not Damaged Water resistance is good I used to wash dishes wearing it No use of Alexai think its a good buy after months of usageall over Amazfit GTS Mini New Version is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback apart for this other things are really niceSleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watchRather all thing are fantastic and battery life is day in normal

"Beast in budget!,Fake negative reviews.,great product under low price range",Bought it in Januaryposting it in August So ive used it almost months and giving honest reviewIn short if you are getting it during sale time then its a steal dealalso in regular price bw its a good productSound quality is good Enough loud at volume Bass is also ok Whenever needed it produces punchy bass Overall balancedMic quality is good in indoor conditionbut in noisy environment you cant rely on this Recevier cant clearly listen to youYou can do gaming as company claiming low latencyi myself didnt test itNow about battery backupcompany claim it will give battery backup of hours with case hours in single chargeAdditional hours times charge via case But in practical use it gives total hours playback It will give around hours backup on single charge of buds volumeif you only listen to music or watching videobut no call or gaming You can charge the earbuds full times via case so additional hoursJust one issue with its designsuit case type box not easy to carry in pocket I would say its a personal preference If you are into good looksdesign then its not for youNow its regular pricing varries between Rs In this price range also it is one of the best tws under I will tell why now a days many brands are launching tws in the market under Most of them sound almost similar difference is like They are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup by youtubersreviewers hours of playtime is just myth Ive personally used TrukeAirbuds liteBuds F which is by far the most false promising brand claiming hours of battery in their every twsbut only give hours Even other tws of boatAirdopes pro which claim hours playback only give around hoursDefy Gravity Z claiming hours only give hours If you are impressed by their looks huge battery backup and thinking to buy thoseyou will be disappointed after purchase Instead go with thisyou will not be disappointedI read the negative comments first and decided not to buy it because the comments said it gives high latency on gaming like PUBG and also it falls from ear while running And that the difference between normal and beast mode slightly had differenceBut a PUBG youtuber Recommended me this so I decided to give it a try after trying out myselfLet me provide the facts for youI have a boat rockerz headphone which obviously should be better than this airdope but this airdope surprised me by doing x better in providing accurate sound in PUBGIts been days I used it daily for hours on full charge it has no buttons and it works on touch sensor which was impressive for me and in PUBG it doesnt give delay as written in the comments it has a good latency better than what I had expected from the negative commentsSometimes though I faced the issue where one side of the airdope stops working because its either on standby without detecting the user or a bug which is included in the faqguidehelp card in the box Im satisfied in terms of gamingFor sports like running I wouldnt recommend because it slips away however maybe u can tie the airdope with a thread attached to ur neck so that its safe from landing on the ground Im gonna try that please dont use both the airdopes while running on the roads with vehicles running for your own safety keep one side of your ear free for hearing sounds from your environmentPros The level of volume it gets to is just awesome it can get incredibly loud so if youre at the gym these are perfect Awesome Bass Noise cancellation is just great if you simply put them on without even any music playing u wont be able to hear things around u very well its great for places like Gym Lovely battery life Ive had them a week and only had to charge the case once that too for just a few minutes And the earbuds themselves leave them in case for just five min and youll be getting battery for a long long while They are very comfortable can be used for long periods of time Affordable The touch controls are very responsive tap to pause double tap right one for next song double tap left one for either rewind or previous song Can also pick up calls just by tapping Multiple ear coverings are provided with it Type C portCons The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc The bass is the highlight so its great for music but for movies or gaming you wont get the most crisp audio Some connectivity issues sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work this is occasional not a daily or frequent occurrence Edit after month use its now a very frequent issue The mic quality is good if you are using your phone but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC Sometimes on WhatsApp the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes Not an issue if you are the one dialing i hope its just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issueOverall I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there lol so Im very very happy with themHighly recommended for music andor as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc,3.9,B09N3ZNHTY,1,0,1,1,1,0,14,7,7,15,409.170.984.455.958

manufactured If the device has the same matte black theme this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the devices body As you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishinglythe product has merged with it The little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam coversIt is ultrathin as described by the company withacquiring about a millimeter thickness This thickness can cope with the windowslaptops as they are havingthe rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lowerup bodykeyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screenThis spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lidwill not harm the screen screen frame and laptop lowerup body But still dont put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself The sliding function is very smooth but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usageThe device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lidsNow for the Mac Laptop users it is not a product for yourlaptop and never try this product for your Mac laptops As the Mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers that is theres no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of thisproduct will damage crackbreak the plain glass screenInstallation is easy remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker using the scale for support or else you could stick it a

hasve been made upon personal usages experiments experiences perspectives for specific products acquired deliveredI usually dont trust my webcam so I thought of giving this product a try It was delivered within days after placing the order I received it on th June First impressions were really good I always had a fear that It would crack my screen when I close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but Its been months and theres not even a single crack in my screen𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 You will get webcams covers in the package Its extremely thin So It wont cause any issues when you close the laptopHp pavilion gaming used here but It might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like MacBook Air Asus TUF Asus ROG while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen At the end its your choice𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 I am sorry to say that the Adhesion of this product is quite weak It literally falls off after a week of applying it I had to throw of it as it became useless I only had the last piece remaining𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 Eventually I was able to find a solution for this problem Remove the Stock Adhesion by gently applying Isopropyl alcohol Then apply a strong Adhesive glue I used Fevi Kwick Apply it only on the back edges of the webcam cover Since its extremely thin I used thin needle to apply Super Glue gently on it or else the Superglue will spill out and make a mess Immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop And then youre good to goIts been months after using the Super Glue technique Forget about about falling It has not even moved a bit No effect on the quality of my webcam The cover wont interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings And fully covers it when you want privacy Overall Its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesionGood productI wish I had known this before ordering Luckily a friend made me aware the very same day I had applied itApple urges people not to close their MacBook MacBook Air or MacBook Pro while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your MacBook It may also affect the ambience light sensor but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costsMacBooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper mm should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop This item is inches thick that is mm six times the recommended thicknessIf you are going to use it on your MacBook be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop You can use it without worry on iMac as its a desktop and doesnt get closed You can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isnt embedded inside the glass screen If you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okayFor disappointed MacBook users like me there are two options One is you trust Apple who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light According to them one cannot work without the other so even if someone hacks your camera you will know it is on because the green light will be glowingIf youre not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera use a piece of thin tape Apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen but frankly if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing i dont see how there could be an issueWhy am I still giving this product stars It reached in good condition is easy to install and use and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera Its not a bad product They just need to stop advertising it for

"Worth Every Square Inch.,VFM, Plastic build. Must buy,3 years of extensive usage , delivered the perfomance to its price,Still working after 2 years,Low in price but sound was high,Super head phone under 1300 rs,Wow nice this headphone Just like fall in love🥰 ye kuchh jyada hi ho gya😜,Good quality",UPDATEIts been months since I first got Boat Rockerz Some of the dislikes Ive mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but Im quite used to it and Im loving it the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong You might ask why Here is whyAfter a long gap I visited my Father who is an audiophile He has numerous highend headphones but unfortunately he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it I said yes I regret it he paired it with his device and played a song Boy you got to see the grin on his face D He said Im keeping it you buy another one Poor me was forced to buy another one A few days back I got another one One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD Both my audio cable had the same issueSo the moral of the story is Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother they will unceremoniously snatch it from youJokes apart people you cant go wrong with this purchase Its worth every square inchHappy ShoppingEND OF UPDATEI got this product days back and I got it for Rs lightning deal of course This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the productThree days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I cant help the excitementLikes Good built quality It is sturdy for the price the build quality is great It is not flimsy The ear cushions are good enough Sound qualityIf you are an audiophile this is not for you Bass is decent nothing to go overboard as noticed in other reviews Bass is deep enough for the price Connectivity pairing is easy connects like a breeze Dual Mode Wired and wireless Boat rockerz comes with an aux cableIf you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone I couldnt find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though I absolutely loved this feature Battery backup Im impressed with the battery backup of this beast Ive been using it for days for hrs a day still its running So i guess the hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume its true So far so good will update it after a months usageDislikes Sound quality is more on the flatter side When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX Street II bass is not too deep You wont get that ambiance Boats website saysDont just be loud be loud and clear Nope sorry Ive to disappoint you on this When its loud its not at all clear A lot of distortions are there when you are loud Comfort Believe me its not at all comfortable for prolonged usage Your ear will beg you to take it off after mins If you have high fortitude you can push it till hrs If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman Range Boats says meters range In my experience if you go beyond meters then the voice will break You will never ever get mtrs range trust me on that And Im experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I dont know whether it will be a problem down the line Will let you guys know about it later if its a problem Flimsy aux cable I cant complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind Remember I paid only for it But with certain devices the aux was not working properly Mi note had issues Mi also had issues with aux Not sure whether its the problem with my device But it worked flawlessly on my laptop Wafer thin service centers Boat gives yr warranty but what good is it if you cant find any service centers near you This is a hit or miss guys Voice cancellation I didnt find this effective Maybe its just me not sure Microphone is pretty much useless You cant make calls with this headsetSome alternatives These are all wired headphones comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to youSennheiser CX Street II I dont think Boat can beat this ones quality The sound is incomparable the base is deep nice fidelity nice ambiance and for a price of this is unbeatable budget wired inear headphone I own of this beauty Total value for money If you are an audiophile and are on a tight budget then I cant a better alternative than this SoundMagic EC InEar Headphones with Mic BlackGold This is another TVFM earphoneSony Extra Bass MDRXB OnEar HeadphonesDont buy it If you are an audiophile obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones D If you intend to use it for long hoursBuy it If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance If you require a wired and wireless package in oneVerdict Id give this headphone a score of If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hasslefree Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you wont regret it you wont be disappointed In this price range I couldnt find any other headphone with such a performance We dont have many options Do we P PThe actual price is Rs and Amazon claim they are giving discount pls dont fall for that I would not recommend paying more than rupees for this headphoneNote Im not an expert in this field This is just a lay mans reviewThank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decisionMy boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV Laptop and my phone I have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola i chanced upon thisValue for moneyGood bassNice sound qualityGood build but not premiumIf you can get it below rs then it is a very good dealits difficult to let go of my boat headphones i bought this on for a k price on sale the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year i know this would happen and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in ive been using it with the aux cable for almost years again but later the top headphone band broke off i used a fevistick to stick it up and used it i stretched it even further but it broke again but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far its been a soldi years since usage of this product still trying to stretch it further if it doesnt work i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality theyve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays evolutions aside i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far I genuinely reviewed after years and its still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using YouTube video overall its very good purchase for meDont think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth itI recently purchased the boAt Rockerz Bluetooth headphones They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable The battery life is also impressive with up to hours of playback Overall Im very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphonesUnder rs it is best head phone sound quality super bass good noise cancelation not bad product weight not heavyNice headphone nhibole to jhakasSound quality is very good and bass is also good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that hhh laalach karna buri chijh h hum sudhrenge nhi kabhiI think u r bored sum of this headphone mast hai enjoyingGood quality easily connected my lg k smart

"Beyond expected,Good,Perfect Juicer - Very User Friendly in usage,User friendly and convenient to use for fresh juice,Excellent Little Juicer! Fast and Easy to Clean. Produces Very Good Quality Juice,Premium juicer,Good however...,Most effective and convinient juicer i Ever had",First of all i wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly so i reviewed many juice blender and finally i bought this Philips HR i made carrotapple Orange promoganateetc All i did and had fantastic juice Fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash thanks for this instant juice blenderGood dealI find this Juicer amazing endtoend it takes me around mins to extract the juice clean pack it back That easy it is to UseThe product is very good and user friendly Exactly as demonstrated in videoI used to have juicer many moons ago but it was a cheap model and never really produced the juice I wanted and I couldnt afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so I was excited to be able to start using this new one First off this is a nice compact design It really doesnt take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surfaceThe juicer is simple to take apart and put together instructions are not really needed though there are some basic pictures provided on the boxThe juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small I need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not a huge flaw it is a shame as you wouldnt need it to be much bigger to get them in So far my juicing attempts have all been successful apples raspberries grapes cucumbers carrots have all yielded a fair amount of great tasting juice I also unwittingly popped a chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesnt work with it seemed to work fine for me I can see how a banana or avocado might not work but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment The pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and I found I could easily squeeze liquid out but its in no way dripping and I would say a decent job had been done I know that there is a lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldnt want in the pulp That way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with itJuicers produce different quality juices There are really key areas to judge a juicer on its juice quality Some juicers produce a higher amount of juice per food item You can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted Some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients A faster spinning juicer centrifugal will often produce more heat and froth which is why the masticating style juicer slower chewing action creates better quality juiceIn terms of these key areas this Philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice The slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers To get more descriptive I like to run the pulp of the Philips through the juicer time to get extra juice out of it Running it a nd time and I get hardly any juice One extra run of the pulp is sufficientThe specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under minute I think this is a little optimistic but that said its not too far off All the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes a little more effort is the metal sieve and grater This has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff That said I have found that using a soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly It certainly does not take much elbow grease and I found it very easy to clean off unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used itI think this is a pretty decent juicer for the everyday user Yes it could produce a little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits The anti drip spout is not quite antidrip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as I have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place For the current price I would say it is well worth itHigh quality premium juicer with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max to juice out of fruits and veggies The look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are availableI have been using this for a month nowIt is easy to use and clean and assembleBut at times I have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grindingI feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice cause if i cut like a sliceflat one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulpTry to cut the carrot pieces of atleast inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and it takes minutes to cut grind and cleanvery easy to use and very easy to assembleThanksPerfect home juicer easy to clean assemble and comparable i loves it,4.3,B00S9BSJC8,1,0,1,1,3,0,17,8,8,20,409.170.984.455.958
"Best option in 35k category.,Terrific purchase,A highly priced smart phone.,Can't get better at this cost. Review after one month of use.,Oxygen OS is providing poor experience, overall device is okay.,Ammazing Product,Okay",I am using OnePlus R GB GB more than one month It is my first ever OnePlus phone My personal review about this phone is as underPros Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice Cover quality is very nice Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness Also screen color and touch response feels premium Battery life is very impressive with day backup with normal use watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within to minutes I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt which runs very smoothI think itll play heavy games smoothly So it perform well I am new to use Oxygen OS I feels OS premium and smooth without adds Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update No heating issue LightweightCons If you use without case it doesnt feel like premium phone I dont like the sound quality although is has dual speaker You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad Selfie camera needs improvement Zoom is very bad on rear camera No IP certification No expendable storage Paid theme store Should have some dot notch animations like samsung At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs you can go for itTerrific purchase at the price of k Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also Metallic sides could be a better option Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there Camera quality is good not awesome Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand Love to see metallic frames in coming phones Storage is tremendous and speed is also good m Overall a good purchase a phone can be rated out of This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use But battery life is not good enough though is says mAh Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment Although its Oxygen os it is not well optimised From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor The company taking around k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below k If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model dont go for this model because of the brand One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update Another bad thing its primary camera design One of the three camera is so big that its embracing to say its price is kI would like to get directly to the pros and consPros BATTERY The first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges Its just amazing and I have been kind of spoilt by it now I wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore CAMERA The camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures No complains LOOKS The phone looks really beautiful I got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium lookingCONS The overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of Having said that the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent Its otherwise quite smooth The absence of an alert slider was a disappointed I was used to it on my TVolume Not too happy with the phone speakers They somehow are not up to the markTo sum it up Just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking good performing phone It packs too much for a k phone good battery fastest charging in the segment premium looks good performanceUsing the phone after two days I have noticed weird experience with UI tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre its common issue across all phones and getting fixed by Oxygen update as there were no issue with proSo we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new OS update on the R and other models as wellOverall device working good so far I experienced average camera resultssuperb charging but not so extended battery life touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks hopefully UI and OS updates will help to deliver best of this phoneOver all camera is just ammazing I am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is its processer dimencity max its a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also its runs very smoothly and its my FIRST PREMIUM SMARTPHONE Im the uploded photosx zoom lg pic and I have uploded night and day liting pics to compareGood device from one plusIts speaker is not really working well using it since months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate

"Should you buy this?, read to find out ....,Good one,Good,Best product,Stopped working in just 18days and worst after sale service,Perfect,Price seems to be high,Solid one .better and best one.",Seller Cloudtail India Private LimitedPrice Price can drop as low as Delivery One day Prime BangalorePackage Big carton box with air pack No damageRecommended YesReturnable YESRoom Heaters which one do you needBefore my review I will let you know which one should you buy An oil heater is best that you can buy but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than months and well below deg For normal winter uses I recommend buying Convection type heaters with fan and Thermostat Please avoid conduction based ones They can consume less power cheap but they are very slow plus burns oxygen Also note whichever you buy make sure it has a Thermostat settingProduct ReviewThis product from USHA is a convection type room heater and I have listed the below features and information Twin Blade fan Thermostat builtin Like AC will turn onoff as per temp changes WW operation W means faster heating Fan only mode for normal table fan type Cant adjust speed ONOFF Power LED when it operates Fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm A Power plug and m cord length Retracting stand to elevate height about inches year warranty for the productThe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat No Swing option very directional You must position it correctly and securely The Thermostat option is good to have and I suggest buyers to buy with thermostat as this will help reduce your EB bills as well as give comfortable weather inside The thermostat is not very accurate like in Air conditioners but works The user manual gives clear information about using itHow to set up Power on select ww The switch is not easy to operate Set to thermostat switch to MAX Anticlockwise Let the heater run till you feel comfortable Warm inside Reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off Leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater ON till morning Note if you have mistakenly set it wrongly turnoff and turnon Once again follow the same step aboveI use this for my sleeping room which is about x size In Bangalore it is about deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks and it took about minutes to bring it deg with w in almost closed room Please note if your place has a room temperature Not outside temp well below and it not exposed to sunlight then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature In such cases only use W setting It does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help But you must keep your window slightly open never use it on a closed roomA or AI see this as a main problem as in many of our houses we only have A for Washing machines and AC socket which is not easily reachable This unit can only be plugged into A socket The reason is when you operate a v unit with A socket you can only draw a maximum of Watts v x A from that socket However since this unit operates also at W it requires A as that could only provide up to W v x A like ACs etc However you can safely use this unit from a normal A socket ONLY IF YOU ARE USING AT W ALWAYS Just buy a A to A converter socket and use this Do not worry it will work just fine but never use W though If you house has MCB Tripper then its much safeTips Always keep some space from all sides of the heater unit First try with fan unit for minutes before using for heater Using after a long storage Keep a window slightly open for fresh air Air can feel dry after sometime can cause nose irritation and dryness Room must be ventilated adding water tray can helpDrawbacks Fan noise sometimes unbearable in a calm room Average Build quality and finishingFinal wordsI recommend this product a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen but makes dry air which can easily be overcome The prices could drop around sometimes so please check price before buying Thanks for reading this if you have any doubts comment belowOn first Day I had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues I am happy on this product Good purchased this Usha T heater which got delivered to me on th Dec We use it moderately for just hrs in dayIt was working fine for days Howeveron th day ie on Jan night after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making khadkhadkhad sound and all its coil were red hot Since we were awake I just switched off the power from main switch It could have resulted into burning or fire if I would have delayed for few more secondsWhen I picked up the heater in hand it looked some part was loosened insideThen on the next day on th Jan I lodged a complaint with Usha customer care na di was told the technician will visit within hrs However no one came in hrs So I called up the technician on the number shared to me by Usha on th After that technician visited me Upon checking he found that out of fans one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heatedI was relaxed that its not a big problem and would be fixed quickly But to my surprise the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed is not able to hold the screw tightly There was a problem with the coupler What kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymoreAdding to my surprise the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement He said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available But he didnt came back When I called next day he said part is not available and has informed the company but cant say when it will be availableSo I called Usha customer care again and they said yes techinician has reported part is not available na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asapSince then I have been calling Usha Customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each otherUsha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced I asked them how many days it may take as I cant keep on waiting for a month they just said they cant say when it would be availableSince it is too cold nowadays and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this Usha heaterIf they will replace it after a month winter would have already passed by thenThis is a worst after sale service from big brand like Usha and it was not expected from Usha If they dont have the basic parts available with the service center what is the use of sending technician empty handedFrom now on I will never recommend Usha to anyone and if any Usha representative is reading this post I request to them to service my heater asapThanksGo ahead The cord is very short and required amp plug point It eats up available oxygen in closed roomUsing since one year found fit for house use,3.8,B00H0B29DI,1,1,1,1,4,1,15,9,10,19,409.170.984.455.958
"Hassle free bagless vacuum cleaner | No more of maintaining/cleaning/replacing bags,Nice little vacuum cleaner but with a couple of drawbacks.,Simple and Effective,A,On the heavier side but satisfied with the product,Good quality, heavy noise,Great Product!,Awesome Cleaning Machine",Once you start using a bagless vacuum cleaner you will never turn back using it on a weekly basis since Nov so its a long tern review Coming from another vacuum cleaner that had bags this one is truly a hasslefree cleaner at least you are away from the hassle of maintainingcleaningreplacing bags which is truly a mess and you would understand only if you have used cleaners with bags Further devices with bags tend to get chocked now and then leading to less suction INSIDE BOX Vacuum cleaner unit Flexible pipe with integrated retraceable brush and suction adjustment knob Turbo brush nozzle Multiclean nozzle High suction flat inlet nozzle Telescopic extension pipe User manual Warranty cardThe power cord is mtr and device comes with a mechanish to retrace it back into the machine It has normal amp pin top which can easily fit in or pin sockets both amp or amp but better to connect it to amp ones only considering its power consumption OBSERVATIONS PROS Device has high suction power and can be cleaned easily with a bagless design where dust collects in a chamber and you can empty it in the dustbinno hassles of cleaning and replacing bags Components are high quality such as the telescopic extension is metallic though its also a con for this attachment Even plastic components are of good quality Device easily moves around owing to its big and smooth wheels You dont need to pull it by force Default flexible pipe itself is long and has an integrated brush that can also be retracted Its a highly useful attachment considering its attached to a primary flexible pipe and is easily available for use Each attachment here is multipurpose When you open the package you feel like very few attachments are provided but when you start exploring you discover that all attachments are multipurpose details below Attachments are easy snap fit and remove ActiveLock in the companys terminology Once you insert the attachments it click locks and can be removed by a press of a button or release lever Both the turbo brush and multinozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning Dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it These filters can be washed once in a while to prevent clogging the Main unit has H filter system to filter fine dust dust mites etc and is equivalent to HEPA as per the company This filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes Device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears Its in the bearable range OBSERVATIONS CONS Telescopic extension is metallic and heavy So its a bit of trouble to use for longer durations especially when you are trying to clean ceilings Reduction of suction power is via a bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction So effectively this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end but then consumes the same amount of power If there had been a control mechanism to reduce power it would also save electricity Device comes with a amp top but its pin so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes it will be a trouble to plug it in everytime I miss the blower system in this cleaner which is handy at times was there in my previous cleaner They could have easily implemented itFor the cons reducing star but its definitely a star device Attachments Flexbile pipe comes with an integrated brush and you can easily retract it back onto the pipe Multipurpose nozzle has a button to increase its suction power and with one press it goes nearer to the floor Turbo brush nozzle sweeps the floor or mattress with rotating bristles along the length and if you want to turn off the rotation of the brush there is a button to lock it Main unit has a system on the back and botton side to attach the multiclean and turbo brush nozzle primarily for easy sweep or for storage purposes FINAL VERDICTThis bagless vacuum cleaner is a hasslefree device and requires very less maintenance but it comes at a cost and if you are willing to stretch your budget its definitely worth it I have had no any issues so far in the past year when using it regularlyThis is a nice bag less vaccum cleaner with a rotating brush that does a great job of cleaning It also comes with good set of accessories I found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the Croma store Two drawbacks not a deal breaker I found and I hope Philips addresses them were It comes with a two pin ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal ampere plugs in the house I was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during minutes of cleaning each room in the house I do not see a point in having that plug During the use one just pulls it along but It has no handle to lift the machine I believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but I am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the clickon mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as a whole all the time while moving the machine without the hoseAs I mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if Philips addresses the issues on this great little machineSuction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet window curtains floors and carpetsCleaning the dust container is also very easy Only concern i have is if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor after using the machine for nearly hour and i pulled out the cord that was in the machine it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this would have been even better if this had blower functionality alsoGood productCord length and Suction power is satisfactoryGood quality heavy noiseThis is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and I can say that I am a happy customer I bought this back in August and it is serving me well It comes with attachments that are convenient and reach high places it has three modes of cleaning tiled floors carpets and sofas and with pets in the house it has made my life that much easier Thank you Phillips for a good product and thank you Amazon for a smooth transactionWellbuilt topnotch quality suction power is too high,4.4,B072J83V9W,1,1,1,1,2,1,17,9,10,19,409.170.984.455.958
"Convenience product,K380 & M350 Lavender,Excellent keybaord,Very handy andneasy to use .. the quality is as expected from logitech,Cool keyboard,Not worth the hype, but manageable,A Robust, High-Quality, Ergonomic Keyboard.,The best Keyboard for a Mac Environment",So I got this keybaord a few days ago and it came in a package that can be best described as being mauled by a bear It was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough I could just pop it back in no problem Thankfully it works fine I tested all the keys and they are functional so lets get to the meat of the subject or paneer if youre vegetarianI think this keyboards performance will vary according to your use case For me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since I had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet I checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard I bought it along with the Logitech Pebble M wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly I dont regret it Both of them fir very well into my work type and theyve made my life a lot more easierThis is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chasseI checked The keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time The major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button Now I personally thought that I wouldnt be using this feature all that much since I was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet But then I realised that I could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts emails on my android tablet at the same time Nowadays I cant stop using this feature since I have my phone tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent It is honestly very neatThe keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than lets say square keys and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing This comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately Teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion but nonetheless it has a good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable It does not have a number pad as you migth have seen from the product images so if you are someone that crunches a lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboardThe latency is quite low from my perspective I dont think they have that crispy Logitech Lightspeed tech built into it though but you wont be using this for gaming and if you are planning to then please dont This keyboard performs horribly in gaming and I mean its terrible This is a keybaord targeted at people who do a lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind If I am ambitious enough I can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket because of how small it is Like my friends say I have small hands well this keyboard was probably designed for a rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord Sometimes while I am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything I am doing goes into stasis But that is more of a me problem than a problem with this keyboard It does come with arrow keys which is very surprising They actually managed to squeeze it inI mean thats pretty much it for this keybaord Dont buy it for Rsk I suggest waiting for a discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much I would say this is like a RsK keyboard but thats just my opinion If you are buying this for the android experience then I suggets buying it bunded with the mouse Because both of them kind of complete each other With that being said Im going to conclude my reviewMouse came turned on Apart from that no issues discovered till now it going goodIts one of the best budget keyboards I have ever used the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click not lift off weight easy on the fingers its been around yr since I bought this keyboard and Iam using it ever since no issues so far and Iam highly satisfied with my purchase definitely gonna recommend it Very good typing experience so far Caps Lock indicatorHeight isnt adjustableNo backlightThe key travel is very very less please keep that in mind Otherwise a decent product at the price rangeI bought this in combination with a Logitech Pebble M Bluetooth Mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my iPad It has made my tasks easier and with recent iPadOS updates there are tons of shortcuts that make iPad experience more productive Since I was going for a retrolooking device I chose Sand color Makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish Connectivity is fast You just switch it on and its connected to your primary device in a matter of seconds even less They keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environmentYou can connect upto devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of a button Im also using the setup for gaming Will maybe update later about that experienceFinal Comments Ergonomic economic portable and lovely Recommend buy for all who need to get work done fastThis Keyboard is awesome It has a flawless connectivity and a great size for portability Just that it is not fitted with a lift at the back and I miss the backlight design but it is a value for money product Works flawlessly with mac as well as Windows,4.5,B0148NPH9I,1,0,1,1,2,0,10,9,9,12,409.170.984.455.958

of improvement in the vocals they were clearer than before but overall average The treble was again very good the highfrequency sounds were clear pleasant to ears The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads was decent When listening to music the overall sound quality is amazing you can easily distinguish between different instruments sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphonesNoise Isolation ComfortWhen it comes to Noise Isolation Boat BassHeads are very good at it They come with medium sized ear tip preinstalled which seemed perfect for my ears once the earphones are on I wasnt able to hear outside noise they sealed my ears completely delivered an immersive experience Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation comfort Overall Boat BassHeads are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff somewhat awkward when used for longer periods Since the housing is made up of metal you may find them popping out every now then when used during running jogging or any other sport or physical activity this didnt happen as often for me but for a friend they keep popping out every now then while running maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it When using BassHeads with Ear Hooks they were a bit uncomfortable initially but as I got used to them they were fine plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on themFlat Cable MicrophoneThe cable is great I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free comes with a rubberized coating The cable does its job well The microphone is again exceptionally good it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise During calls the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick upreject calls on the go without taking your phone out It can also be used to control music which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads Warranty PriceBoat BassHeads comes with standard One Year Warranty so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe in case you need it for warrantyFinal ThoughtsIve personally used Boat BassHeads InEar Headphones for more than two weeks average daily two hours of listening before writing this review and Im pretty much impressed with them Im personally a fan of Extra Bass IEMs and currently my primary IEM is Sony MDRXBAP which again falls under Extra Bass category Comparing Sony MDRXBAP with Boat BassHeads will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them but I would still like to add that BassHeads did a great job and didnt disappoint me obviously it doesnt stand a chance in front of Sony MDRXBAP but still looking at the price of BassHeads the quality they offer I was really very impressedBoat BassHeads turned out to be exceptional earphones after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices music players I can say that theyre amazing for the price a pure steal deal The bass output is amazing and is very intense Ill recommend using correct size ear tips good quality music player like Poweramp Android for better bass output The treble is good vocals are average somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results The mids are again averageMy Rating out of The VerdictTaking everything into account overall Im very impressed with Boat BassHeads The Built quality is amazing the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass good overall soundstage Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals mids highs Overall the vocal highs are good mids are average but still good for the price Ill recommend these IEMs to bass lovers budgetconscious people who are looking for high quality durable earphones at a reasonable price Genres like EDM Rock HipHop sound really great on them Boat BassHeads justify the price they come for the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price rangeHOPE I HELPED YOUTHANKSYes so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under Yes you can consider it to buy But there are few points to remember before buy From my user experience I can tell you this This is not comfortable at all It slips from ear mostly You feel pain in ear after using it Never buy this for ONLINE CLASS as it is not possible to wear it hours straightly After switching from Boat Basshead I feel that the bass is not good as the previous one I dont know why It should be better Sound dont explode or go outside of the buds to as it go outside on Boat headphone so its good Feeling heavier on ears Not as comfortable as Realme Buds Though both are metal build For balance sound you can buy Realme Buds Buy it only to listen music not for too long time Do not consider it for Online class and Long time wear session Hope it helped you Its just my opinion from using Boat Boat Boat Realme buds Mi basicIts a very good product but i dont recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head they will fall off easily with the slightest motion you will soon find it annoying Sound quality build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate youRaat me apne Babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha se sunae deta hI purchased the product a year agoIt worked fineI love the sound qualitybut you may not expect it to work after a yearMy headphone doesnt work now properly My warranty get expired so I have to buy a

"VFM and kudos to egate to launch a fhd projector at the lowest price and it is not bad at all,Good Bluetooth Projector,What more can you ask for at this price!!?,Good for winter nights.,Nice purchase,Value for money,WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT...,Value for money",This review is for the native FHD projectorYes it is a native p led projector connected this to my desktop computer and tested also Dont bother trying to play videos from USB Quality is badBut when connected to right streaming or display source thru hdmi it is actually quite good I mean picture quality colours brightness etc for a sub k projector In this department this projector can easily compete with many projectors in sub k rangesSound is also pretty much okay loud enough more like boat w speakers may be a bit more louder not good quality wise Quitr workable as portable solution but not for a permanent setupAudio output to my studio headphones are pretty decent quality wise and loud also Meaning speakers can be connected to it for a higher setup person has to figure out to seperate the audio at the source itselfFrom ft and inches distance of lens to wall we can get exactly inch inch x inch projection So it can be called as short throw projector albiet may be border level There is an option to reduce the screen size upto of original size electronically once connected to HDMIKeystone correction is not usuable at all That wheel has to be exatly in middle position to get a good focus on whole screenThat means one has to setup the projector or screen at a fixed location Can not lilt the projector to move screen up or down and then adjust with keystone correction I e if you want to keep the projector screen at lower levels projector also has to fixed at lower levels only Best focus can be get when projecting exactly oppsite to the projector probably to inch above so if we flip the projector upside down we get best focus opposite to center a few inches downFor mysetup where projecting only feet above from the floor going to use a wall mount to setup the projector upside down this way i can fix the projector a bit more abovebehind the sofa I will post the pics later once it is setup properlyNow the verdict this projector with a combination of reflective projector screen look it up on amazon xelectron or minago brand is one of most vfm combo for approx k for experiencing a very bright inch screen experience of good quality for or person But now that im considering buying one of those expensive fixed frame alr projector screens costing upward of k to k im thinikg it would have been better if i could have invested a bit more on a brighter projectorlook only ANSI value This buy was more of an impulse purchase but it is more then good enough for me now to make me consider much costlier projector screens and then later upgrade to a high end projectorEdit the biggest drawback of this projector is that dust gets inside on lcd panel which impacts the clarity also after a few days I had to clean the panel myselg just after month New lesson learnt apart from high ansi lumen projector this is also an important factor for future purchase Planning to get a custom cloth cover made so that i dont have to clean it often Though Lcd cleaning can be done pretty easily without much opening and its easier compared to youtube videos i have seen for previous model Somehow lens did not get any dust inside yet Only the lcd has very very fine dust particles insideQuality is good value for Money Bluetooth Connectivity is smooth and fast The sound quality of the Projector is not so great but that we had already considered before Hotstar App really works nicely with great quality and so does Youtube Netflix Prime video doesnt give the same quality initially but that must be wifi connection Some apps however dont get installed or just close on their ownThe good point is the Bluetooth connection and even we have added a Bluetooth soundbar so moving it and putting it in any room has become a really good optionThis is indeed a fantastic product in this price rangeit is non android so you need to add an amazon fire stick or some other source device through HDMIneedless to say the brightness is pretty good for dark environments and is also watchable during day ie if you can cover up your windows and other light sourcesScreen spread is Almost up to inch at a throw distance of to feet with the sharpness more or less intactconverts K to PWill recommend a tripod mount or a custom made mount like mineensure that the walls are white for best image video reproductionDefinitely recommended at this price pointConsOnly vertical Keystone correction availableProjector is good so far as it used for last days May revisit the feedback after a couple of monthsI bought this projector for my classroom and its very helpful for their studies Now students connect themselves more to the worldI feel Its a value for money product as I have already used it for last two monthsIf u r looking for a home entertainer projector look no further THIS IS IT BEST IN PRICE GOOD PICTURE QUALITY BRIGHTNESS AND A DECENT REMOTE WITH GOOD FUNCTIONALITY As always premium buyers avoid as these r for normal home with normal needs Very good for family get together movie nights and kids will be awe struck at its enormity Ive canceled my dth connection Coz AMAZON PRIME TV STICK WITH THIS PROJECTOR IS ALL I NEED THATS ALL THE TIME I HAVE FOR WATCHING TV AMIDST MY WORK AND THEY DO THE JOB WELL An entertaining night after a busy day n you will be done satisfied Any queries ping me Ill help u as much as i can Dont worry abt specs and other details takeit from a family manit will satisfy all ur needsbe it surfing movies or gaming and with fire tv stick mirroring is possible too Hope it helpsUPDATE AFTER MONTHS HRSDAY USAGE The pic uploaded was by noon pm with dark screensHI THIS WAS A REPLY TO A CUSTOMER TO HELP CHOOSE BETWEEN EGATE I N UC BUT I THOUGHT IF THIS WAS PUT UP IN UPDATE SECTION A LOT WOULD BENEFIT SO HERE IT GOESFirst u need to be clear on ur purpose for this projector like if its for offic use or home entertainment also u didnt mention its source like dth or fire tv stick etc since u have not ill go with a general review for purposes ITS GOING TO BE A VERY DETAILED REVIEW SO GUYS WITH OUT PATIENCE CAN RUN TO THE END AT ONCEI too had a similar confusion based on competition for egate i from uc Let me tell u what helped me decideFirst n foremost egate is an Indian company unlike uc which is a common Chinese product with a namesake brand UC confirmed it with my friend in China Hence service n general trust is more on egate than competitionSecondly from fellow customers Ive learnt that egate is brighter than the rest twoThirdly the images are sharp and theres no blur on text on egate compared to the other two Just learn to adjust the keystone properlyFourth the length of the power cord is longer in egateFifth its got a lens cover to close the lens when not in use The others dont have itNow in general Ive not used the other two but the input of data for the other two are from their users so Im gonna tell u wat Ive done n wat else u can do with egateIve placed it at a length of feet from the screen n it gives awesome display Connect a home speaker system if u r trying for home theatre effect but the inbuilt speaker is good enuf at feet projection from the end of ur bed with kids sleeping aroundIve connected my SECOND FIRE TV Stick with it so it connects to WiFi for movies n serials n mirroring is done by it for playing from mobiles n game too like cod n pubg n FF Also u have connectivity for laptop n pendrive etcU get a remote which functions well along with itMOST IMPORTANTLY U CAN CEILING MOUNT IT OR TRIPOD IT TOO WHICH THE OTHER TWO CANT BUT remember if u r ceiling mounting it u need to flip the display by in the settings coz u would mountbit upside down as the option is provided under the projector but for tripod its not necessaryAlso u can place the projector behind the screen LIKE AN ACTUAL THEATRE IF U R USING A CLOTH SCREEN LIKE ME N CONSTRAINT OF SPACE BUT REMEMBER TO FLIP THE IMAGE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IN SETTINGS AS THE PROJECTOR IS BEHIND THE SCREEN N U NEED TO GET A FLIPPED IMAGE FROM BEHINDso I guess its the d part that made ur decision murky wat I would love to say for that is Ive a Samsung d enabled smart tv n Ive seen the output of these kind of cheap d devices too since its a low cost projector d effects are going to give u a headache coz of pixelation better to opt for a TV if d is a priority as in TV the d effects r awesome But nowadays u can install an APP IN ANY DEVICE to watch d movies or better download a d movie in pendrive n play it n watch it with ur d glasses My friends do it but I DONTVERDICT BEST PROJECTOR IN MARKET IN MY OPINION FOR THE PRICE AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSENOTE FOR AMAZON PRIME N NETFLIX USERS IF U R USING A AUDIO OUTPUT SOMETIMES U MIGHT NOT GET AUDIO SO DONT GET WORRIED N ITS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROJECTOR ITS JUST THAT THE LATEST MOVIES ARE MADE WITH DOLBY SOUND SO JUST USE THE ON SCREEN SETTING IN THE VIDEO TO NAVIGATE TO SOUND N CHOOSE STEREO FROM THE DEFAULT DOLBY OPTION VOILA U R DONEHOPE IT HELPS PING ME FOR ANY DOUBTSHIT LIKE IF MY REVIEW WAS USEFULAs per money its bestBut if you are fan of pictures qualityThink about budget,3.9,B088Z1YWBC,1,1,1,1,2,1,15,9,10,17,409.170.984.455.958
"Needs accessories,Gets water hot in under 10 mins,Slightly disappointed,Useful,Value for your money,Havells water heater is an excellent product.,v.nice,This product is very good and easy to use",Immersion heaters have changed very little in terms of features or design over the years or so Ive been using them And regardless of which brand name is stamped on them they look like clones of each other It was therefore with some excitement that I bought this Havells model that had at least three novel features an autocutoff facility a temperature control knob and a protective plastic cover for that part of the heater users could come into accidental contact with But quite a bit of my excitement drained away when the heater arrived I couldnt use it straightaway because it has a cord thats barely a metre long and it just couldnt reach the A socket it needs to be plugged into Such heavyduty sockets are normally positioned high in most bathrooms so that they are easily accessible to any storage waterheaters that may be installed Havells should have made allowances for this and added at least another footandahalf to the cord length For a largescale manufacturer this extra length would have made little difference to the production cost The product anyway is priced a couple of hundred Rupees more than other W heaters the MRP being even higher at RsIn my case therefore the heater had to be accessorized before it could be used I had to buy a stool that would raise the the bucket off the floor and thus compensate for the shortness of the cord And no it cant be any stool lying around in your home it has to be a stool of a certain height about inches for me Any taller and the bucket cant be accommodated under the tap any shorter and you begin cursing Havells again for their miserliness with the cord The stool took two days to arrive and I inaugurated the heater a full four days after it was delivered Thank God my old immersion heater was still usable in spite of its heavily calcified conditionThere is yet another problem with this heater though it helpfully allows you to choose between three temperature settings you dont know what value each setting corresponds to What does high temperature mean degrees Celsius Seventy I found out the hard way when I set the temperature high and the heater wouldnt switch itself off for minutes which is five minutes longer than the time my old heater takes to heat up some litres of water And by then the water had turned scaldingly hot I tried the medium setting the next day and again had the nasty experience of having to deal with extra hot water Perhaps the right setting is low then Im not sure Neither the product literature that came with the heater nor the Havells website has any information that will help you choose the right setting and stop you burning yourselfSo both the innovative features of this heater that made me buy it the variable heat setting and the autocutoff ultimately turned out to be quite useless I still have to depend on my instinct and on my experience with my old featureless heater and manually turn the heater off when I think its done its jobI have a question for other users of this product or for the manufacturer can the temperature be set to inbetween values something between low and medium for instance The way the controlling knob is marked with several lines between the presets suggests this is possible Or maybe thats yet another useless feature of this fancy heater More trialanderror But should such a basic piece of equipment be so difficult to useUpdateAfter a weeks use of this heater Id like to add a word of caution for the benefit of other buyers and users Since the heater has its own indicator light which switches off at the set temperature you may forget to switch the socket switch off particularly if the switch is away from the socket as in some contemporary bathrooms that have all switches bunched together at the bathroom door If you forget to switch the socket off and in the meantime have removed the heater from the bucket it will begin to heat up again once the temperature has fallen below the set value This dryheating will damage both the heater and wall if youve hung the heater up But more significantly it will also be extremely hazardous if your body is wet and theres no one around to switch the socket off for you This happened to me twice Call me dumb if you want to but please be carefulThe product is good and does its work I didnt find any use of the thermostat feature as though it turns off automatically the low temper in itself is very hot It take just to mins to get the water be bath ready Further the product says that ilthe rod should not touch the bucket but the product handle is made in such a way that it touches but that causes no trouble Its not shock proof so dont check temperature of water with it turned onProduct received with some scratchesDont know how inside package product gets scratchesOther than that all is okay product is goodAnd its shock proof for extra safety but no recommended to touch waterValue for moneyProduct is good satisfactory one minor issue the cord is little too hardIts working as expected no issues found till now but i have observed the red light is not coming fully i could see only partial red light is visible overall best productniceThis product is very good and easy to use but its plug is of amps which should have been of amps,4.2,B088ZTJT2R,1,0,1,1,3,0,14,9,9,17,409.170.984.455.958
"Original review 👍realme buds🎧,Please Read The Whole Review For All the Details & Decide Yourself...,Good,Ful HIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BASE,Amazing,Good",Realme Buds Wireless design and specificationsTruly wireless earphones are becoming very popular and we could very well see Realme get into that space in the coming months However for now the company has taken on wireless headphones in an affordable form neckbandstyle earphones The headset has a flexible neckband with metal modules at the ends short cables that lead to the earbuds and the plastic earbuds themselves We quite liked the yellowandblack colour scheme of our review unit The design is simple and the build quality is decent The device is light at just g and comfortable to wear and use for long hours at a stretchLike earlier Realme earphones the Realme Buds Wireless have magnets in each earbud While they dont serve any purpose on the wired models beyond keeping the two earbuds together the magnetic clamp serves as the power switch for the Realme Buds Wireless Separating the buds turns the headset on while attaching them powers it down there is no power button so this is the only way to control power on the headsetIn theory this sounds good but the weak magnets meant that the earphones separated easily when placed in a bag or pocket This would turn the earphones on and automatically connect with our paired smartphone even when we didnt want it to which was bothersome Calls would be automatically diverted away from the smartphones earpiece without us knowing the battery would run down and the phone wouldnt automatically connect to other devices such as a Bluetooth car audio systemWhat you do get in the sales package are three pairs of silicone ear tips ear wings that are preattached to the earbuds and a MicroUSB cable for charging The charging port is on the underside of the right module which also has the controls for playback calls and volumeThe Realme Buds Wireless earphones are powered by mm drivers with Bluetooth and support for the SBC and AAC codecs The earphones have a claimed battery life of hours on a single charge and are said to offer minutes of listening time on a minute charge when the battery is drained We were able to get around hours of use in our testing while a full charge of the headset took a little under hours to complete Realme Buds Wireless performanceThe Realme Buds Wireless bring a refreshing change to the budget segment offering a great combination of design and sound quality for the price Also fans of electronic music will be happy to know that the Realme Buds Wireless have been tuned with inputs from popular DJ Alan Walker and the sound does come across as geared for this genre the wireless earphones with use AAC Bluetooth codecs We listened to streamed music from Spotify and YouTube Music as well as our collection of highresolution tracksStarting with Take Five by the Dave Brubeck Quartet we immediately noticed that the soundstage was considerably wider and more detailed than what were typically used to hearing from products in this price range Some of the percussion instruments sounded crisp and well defined although the deeper elements in the middle of the track the doublebass in particular was a bit soft and not quite as distinct as wed have liked Still we found the sound to be detailed and rich on the wholeNext we listened to a bit of Indian pop with an Unplugged rendition of Amar Arshis Kala Chasma Apart from some gentle aggression in the low end we also quite liked the inoffensive nature of the mids and highs as demonstrated with the familiar vocals of the track The sound of the Realme Buds Wireless is tuned for comfort and nearuniversal appeal and sticks to that brief We heard just about as much detail and clarity as we could have hoped for from a pair of wireless earphones that cost less than Rs the Realme Buds Wireless as a handsfree headset for voice calls and results were mixed In some cases we found that voices on the other end of the call were soft and our callers reported too much background noise a crow cawing about feet away sounded as if it was coming from right next to us for the person on the other end On other occasions no issues were reported so call quality seems to be largely dependent on your surroundings and possibly the strength of your cellular signal VerdictMore expensive pairs of earphones such as the OnePlus Bullets Wireless and More Stylish Dual Dynamic Driver might offer much more by way of sound quality but the Realme Buds Wireless does a capable job for just Rs This is a product worth considering simply because it is everything you need for the priceThis headset is built well has decent battery life and is very comfortable to wear The only significant problem for us was the magnetic power switch which often led to the earphones automatically powering on at awkward times That aside the Realme Buds Wireless is a pair of earphones that does exactly what its supposed to no more and no less with unwavering consistency and we like it for thatPros Looks good Light and comfortable Detailed rich sound for the priceCons Magnetic power switch is troublesome Inconsistent performance on voice callsRatings out of Design comfort Audio quality Battery life Value for money Overall Go and purchasedFirst of all if you are a ElectronicDance and HipHop Genre kind of enthusiast than your search for a good quality earphone STILL CONTINUES its not like these earphones are worthless for these genres and cannot be listened on these surely you can listen and enjoy it but you just could not get the vibes you get while listening those on deep base earphonesFrom My music listening experience from Years i can tell you that the Depth and that vibrating Surround base effect is not in this it surely has some thumpy bass which is required for perfect balance in every genre but due to lack of that deep base you will definitely regret your purchase if youre a HipHop EDM lover THE MID TONES OF MUSIC ARE A LITTLE LOW IN THIS EARPHONE WHICH ALSO RUINS A LITTLE THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE GENRES SONG LISTENING EXPERIENCETHIS WANNA MAKES ME THINK EVERYTIME IS ALAN WALKER REALLY TUNED THISFOR TRAP HARD DANCE GENRE ITS GOOD BUT NOT THE BESTI can tell you such differences because I am also using a wired earphone namely MI Earphones PRO rs which is excellent and produces very great sound for every genre and definitely have that deep base effectRATHER THAN FOR THOSE GENRES SONG THESE EARPHONES ARE REALLY GOOD FOR EVERY OTHER GENRES If Youre Fine with the above listed drawbacks Then only head towards the detailed reviewUPSIDES THE MATERIAL QUALITY IS GOOD ITS PLASTIC BUT FEELS LIKE A SOFT SILICON LAYER IS APPLIED OVER ITS TOP LAYER BOTH ON THE NECKBAND AS WELL AS THE WIRES OF THE EARPLUGS THESE ARE EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT AND DOESNT FEELS A LIKE EXTRA LOAD ON YOUR NECK AT ALL NOISE CANCELLATION IS REALLY VERY GOOD IM REALLY IMPRESSED MIC QUALITY IS ALSO THE BEST THAT CAN BE OFFERED IN RANGE No Complaints THE EARPLUGS FIT IS GOOD BUT I ADVICE YOU TO REMOVE THOSE REMOVABLE ANGULAR PADDINGS FOR MORE SNUG FIT AND COMFORT IS FINE BUT COULD BE MORE BETTER AS MY WIRED ONES ARE REALLY MORE COMFORTABLE AND IF YOU HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THIS THEN YOU CAN ALSO COMPLAIN ABOUT ITS COMFORT FOR LONG USE THE BLUTOOTH RANGE IS REALLY GOOD STILL WORKS IF ROOMS ARE IN BETWEEN THE MAGNETIC ONOFF CONTROL IS LIKE CHERRY ON CAKE AND WORKS LIKE CHARMWHEN YOU SEPERATE THEM IT TAKES SECONDS TO CONNECT WITH YOUR PHONE IF ALREADY PAIRED BEFORE AND IF PHONES BT IS ON AND IF YOU ATTACH THEM TOGETHER THEY GO TO STANDBY MODE AND GOES OFF IF NOT OPENED AGAIN WITHIN MINUTES ITS REALLY GOOD THAT YOURE GETTING THIS MAGNETICFUNCTION IN THIS PRICE SOUND CAN GO REALLY LOUD BUT I PREFER TO USE IT ON MICRO USB CABLE PAIR OF EXTRA EARTIPS SMALL LARGE ARE PROVIDED IN BOX MEDIUM IS PREAPPLIED AND IS PERFECT NEARLY FOR EVERYONE BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD EXPECT HOURS OF CONTINUOS PLAYBACK ON VOLUME CHARGING SPEED IS ALSO GOOD YOU CAN EASILY GET HOUR OF PLAYBACK ON O MINUTES OF CHARGE AND CAN FULLY CHARGE IT AROUND MINUTES IF FULLY EMPTY DID NOT GET TO EXPERIENCE ITS SPLASH RETENTION PROPERTYDOWNSIDES THE OUTER COVER OF EARPHONES ARE OF PLASTIC GOOD QUALITY BUT THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALUMINIUM FRAME IN THIS PRICE THE WIRES SHOULD ALSO BE GIVEN AS BRAIDED ONE FOR ROUGH AND LONG USE NO REALME BRANDING PERMANENT ANYWHERE ON THE EARPHONE CONFUSES US BUT THERES TAG ATTACHED ON THE NECKBAND THE CAP ON THE CHARGING PORT SHOULD HAVE GIVEN TO PREVENT DUST FROM ENTERING SMALL CARRY CASE OR POUCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO MAKE IT TRAVEL FRIENDLY WHEN CONNECTED TO THE DEVICE WHEN THERE IS AN INCOMING CALL IT DOESNT RECITES THE NUMBER OF CALLER AND IT SOMETIMES DOESNT NOTIFIES AT ALL BUT NO MAJOR CON IS THERESOUND QUALITY THE VOCALS ARE REALLY AMAZING NOW I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS OF POP SONGS THE LOWS AND HIGHS OF THE SONGS ARE REALLY GREAT BUT MIDS ARE LITTLE SUPRESSED AND YOU WOULD DEFINITELY MISS THAT IN EDM AND HIPHOP SONGS as that evary low details are not required in dance songs the Mids Highs are more important THE BASE IS ADEQUATE AND KEEPS THE SONG ALIVE BUT NOT PRODUCES THAT WELL DEEP AND SURROUND BASE THAT YOUNGSTERS LOVE BUT IT DEFINITELY HAS THAT AMOUNT OF BASE REQUIRED IN ANY SONG TO FEEL IT IM ALSO A YOUNSTER AND IM FINE WITH IT AS IVE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE FOR WATCHING MOVIES AND SERIES ON TV SILENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING MY FAMILY SO THIS FULFILLS MY PURPOSE THE BEAT AND SOUND PRODUCED FEELS NATURAL AND CLEAR LIKE HIGH QUALITY HEADPHONES AND IN THIS RESPECT ALAN WALKER AND REALME TEAM HAD SURELY DONE A GREAT WORK BASED ON TYPES OF MUSIC LOVERS I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO POP INDIEPOP ACOUSTIC RB Rock and soft Rock TRAPHARD DANCE NEARLY ALL KINDS OF GENRES EXCEPT EDM AND HIPHOPAS IVE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE SO I DO NOT HAD ANY GREAT

"Using it with my QC 3 Charger .So far- So good.A Quality cable with a sturdy construction & troublefree performance.,Awesome product go for buy it 👍,Execellent,Sturdy micro USB cable for Old phones,Super,Product description says 3 feet it's hardly a foot length wire.,Good,Excellent quality cable",ABOUT AMAZONBASICSxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in is Amazons own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goodsHere amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand already exist in the market but at lower prices Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable pricesIf something isnt an immediate hit Amazon pulls it and moves onAmazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers onlineAs an additional benefit Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined immediately taken care ofABOUT OUR PRODUCT REQUIREMENT vs ACTUALxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm Qbix car charger was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements DATA EXCHANGESince it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car Data exchange capability was not much of my concern Preference though would surely have been a USB but it didnt bother me if I could only get a USB tooACTUAL PRODUCT I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed LENGTH OF THE CABLE Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob I preferred to keep it short simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or belowACTUAL PRODUCT The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely meters or approximately feet long The length was sufficient for me to plugin any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passengers seat TANGLE FREE FLEXIBILITY STRENGTH STANDARDSI am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunchedACTUAL PRODUCT The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility reasonable thickness a sturdy intermediate cable The whole construction of the cable due its cable size flexibility is almost tanglefreeThe associated cable was not exactly thick but cant be termed as thin or delicate too Its not the thickest Ive seen but then thickest doesnt always means most durable Given my application its more than just suitableThe overall built quality of the cable insulation looks promising enough to last few years Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last longI had further shortlisted mansaa an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORSHad an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBsACTUAL PRODUCT There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spacesThe connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A micro B ports The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite goodNo signs of loose constructionBeing Goldplated is more of a misleading fancy termin this case as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways AVAILABILITY OF TIESVELCRO STRAPS As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice addon to properly adjust arrange the cable as per requirementACTUAL PRODUCT This I miss the most in the provided actual cable there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITYOn the newest QC certified chargers the current transmission can go up to amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling abilityACTUAL PRODUCT The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to amps against demands at new QC chargers that could go up to amps Here let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging thus it is not like a continuous flow of amps is there it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above amps would sufficiently work with QC chargersHave tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S from without the cable getting hot WARRANTYComes with a year warranty as expected Not the best in the industry but reasonableOTHER OBSERVATIONSApart from the above listed features the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are The cable is manufactured in China imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name philosophy of amazonbasics The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct it was imported to India in Dec The cable has a MRP tag of bucks however I purchased it online for bucksbeing a prime member shipping was free A customer care toll free number email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievancesFINAL VERDICTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received been using this product So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around I suppose its worth itWill surely update if any malfunction is observedWorth for buyThe quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination simply superb goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition Make in india is good but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers govt should infact encourage such competitionAmazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devicesAs an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesnt also disappointSupports fast charging for all my Samsung phonesI use Samsung apro Samsung splus which this cable is compatible with Very sturdy thick and very long ftVery affordable pricing Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung sfeSuperProduct charging is ok however its mere foot in length the vendor could have mentioned correct product description there is no need to mislead too early to say performance as I have received it todayGoodI have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs and Rs of ubon and of many other chinese local companiesand none of them worked properlyFinall i decided to go for thisAnd it is charging as well transferring data without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice Dont buy cheap chinese local cables ofYou will have to throw them in dustbean after some timeBetter buy this

"Real Monster 👽,Overall good,Good performance oriented phone,An all Rounder in the < 30k segment,All good, battery life could be better.,A good Phone with few disadvantages.,Value for Money product,❤️",Posting This After Days of Continous UsageI came from Oneplus t that too because last to last week I had an accident and my t has dead on the spotAfter watching a lot of reviews on Youtube and Amazon I thought I should give it a chanceFirst Impression As you all know OP t has small display so its hard for first days to useTyping because of big display A little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last t Solid built but it if its metal build then it will be more beautiful Space fusion color is looking killer Flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved Display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps ie chrome brave linkdin etc youll notice a color change from Black to Greyish color that gives a cheap feel and I dont know if its a software or hardware issueActual Review While gaming Call of dutymobile has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notificationcalls even after mute notification ONN everything is coming on screen and its very frustrating and annoying Battlefield mobile ground Asphalt Clash of Clans Battle Royale are working flowless Some apps like Flipkart and Airtel gives some error screen zoom automatically while opening might be because of android or something else Now this is very weird that this phone reset a few setting automatically themselves when I dont want that I dont want to set them everyday before using my phone ie I am using Bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background runWhile listing to music I want paranomic sound but it reset to default automatically Gesture are not working fine this can be fixed with future updates I admit that funtouch OS has some more customization then Oxygen OS but it is missing some basic customization feature like I cannot change accent color shape size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because Oneplus oxygen OS is in my eyes but I am not overcome from oxygen OS Oxygen Os is lub Funtouch OS is very uncomfortable for me for the first days but now Im getting it a little Less feature in gaming mode in comparison to Iqoo Camera Average as of now takes good picture in nightevening time and selfie camera is awsome OIS works good as per the budget and gives value for money Day time picture are good but something it changes the saturationcolor by itself automatically No heat observed while gamingdoing heavy task minimal heat that every phone has now a days and it is c outside so this is not a big deal for me Screen recorder and mic works awsome Crisp clear display except the issue I told above SOT in one charge minutes charging time No bugs lags observed till date Hz refresh rate made it monster Some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use Adb commande to remove permanently A few apps are unnecessary like browser and a screen virus scan comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow I stopped that Speaker volume is sufficient enoug loud in a roomConclusionIn k its worth for money with Snapdragon processor and intelligent chipOnly thing that I dont like is funtoch os because it not gives a premium flagship phone experinceHas some bugs as of now ie In gaming mode in a few apps camera Display that might fixed with future updatesOverall worth for money And Yes you can pick it over Oneplus RT like I said youll probably feel bad for a week with its Funtoch Os but youll be okay with it after sometimeJust because of oxygen os spending k is not a great idea I thinkCamera quality is good Video stability is awesome processing and other functions are nice UI is not that good and battery life is not upto the markPros Super fast app experience due to Snapdragon Super fast charging good display but not comparable with Super Amoled of Samsung other phone Good large display size No heating in general use Only seen when using camera video call but it cools down fast Accessories given with the phone like Fast charger USB c to female adater thin screen guard and translucent back cover Ok cameraCons Display is not super amoled or vivid like Samsung A or S Series phone Battery drains fast Avg front camera Earth current can be felt when touching back camera while chargingI was skeptical about the phone would perform as SD has its own share of heating issues and all but for k this is one of the best phones in the segmentI had Pixel A and Nothing phone as other options Although their camera and software might be better in some aspects the performance the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredibleAlso Pixel and Nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so its a plus pointThe only issue I faced is when I switch the phone to Hz It starts to act as it lowers to fps or something And the battery life is average Its charge in the evening for sure But decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enoughI use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style Recommended to allGood display good sound although sound is not much loud but have a sweet bass smooth experience camera good but front video could be given fps good haptic every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better Overall satisfied with the productThey are ok i can rate Mobile is worth its moneyIdont use fingerprint and camera are very good battery life ok,4.3,B07WHS7MZ1,1,1,1,1,1,1,14,10,11,15,409.170.984.455.958
"Early impression comparing MK215 with MK270  - bit underwhelmed,Lagging,It is working fine till now.,Does the job well,Excellent,Worth,To avoid lag, plug into USB port without neighboring connections,Good",I had been using a Logitech MK for a couple of years before a couple of keys started getting iffy no spills or accidents With an overall positive impression of Logitechs performance compared to my experience with similar from Dell HP I decided to try the slightly cheaper and compact MKWhile I knew this would be more compact with fewer keys I feel I should highlight the disadvantages I can see immediately especially for users of fullsize keyboards at work refer image While my hands will get used to closer keys they also seem much less springy lower Overall size is also too small to place on ones lap and type which I could with the other wireless keyboard especially during WFH Big point is the MUCH larger size of the dongle This will need to be removed and stashed carefully at home every time I throw my laptop into my bag for a meeting I never did this for MK and simply kept dongle fixed forever to my laptop USB port That dongle also had a slot inside the mouse for safekeeping which is not there in MK Neither mouse nor keyboard has a switch off MK had switch on both MK mouse takes AA whereas MK takes battery Mouse is shaped different lower arch and wider which may simply take adjusting Feels a little cheaperWhile a real review can only be provided much later seeing how keysclicks perform over the long run and one hopes that Logitech will have taken care of that quality while I dont have any complaints so far I feel paying a bit extra for the MK may suit many folks out there Hope the review helps will update later if I see find any fundamental issues with timeProduct is good but lagging very muchNot enjoying satisfied with this productBad for meIt is working fine till nowThe keyboard is good but pretty small when compared with regular keyboards It works well and keys and okExcellentGo fot it good product handy just connector is little bit big sizeWorks properlyInitially noticed lag and then looked it up onlineIt seems USB receiver faces interference when another port next to it is plugged in to other deviceI had the lag of both mouse and keyboard actions but noticed that my USB receiver was plugged next to HDMI port which was also connected to a monitor I switched the USB receiver to another USB port on other side of laptop without any neighboring ports Dont face lag nowTry to use a USB hub if you dont have a USB port away from existing used portsBuild quality and all are good but the batteries cap is little bit loose for the keyboard and mouse is totally fine,4.1,B012MQS060,1,0,1,1,2,0,5,10,10,7,409.170.984.455.958
"Good Performing Air Purifier at a Decent Price,Value for money,Nothing earth shaking about this product!,It is good,Great product.,The product is working nicely and worth buying product.,Writing after 1.5 years pros cons solution and trics do read my reviews and vote,Works but no use",Here is a try at a review of this product after using it for an year nowUse Case I am a NCR resident and the air pollution is as we know one of the worst possible if not the worst I have it installed in the bedroom about sq ft so well within the advertised max room space While using the purifier the room is kept closed to minimize pollution additionBuild Quality The purifier is sturdy in its built and aesthetically pleasing It has a large front grill that acts as the air inlet and an arched back that has a larger grill for filtered air outlet The arc helps the air to be released vertically upwards and hence does not add to direct cooling for anyone sitting in front This helps the filters use in winter which is the main season where it is required The top of the filter has a dark panel with touch sensitive buttons and a decent sized circular LED screen The buttons are Power Night Mode Fan Speed and Child LockSetup The air purifier is shipped with its parts packed separately Thus on unboxing the same has to be setup for use The setup is pretty straightforward The main filter units front can be released and the individual filters aligned in order on the central space The installation order of the filter is as followsFirst HEPA Filter The same has indication on top to correct installation You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left CornerSecond Active Carbon Filter The same has indication on top to correct installation You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left CornerThird Pre Filter This one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust impurities so that it does not clog the other main filtersThus the filtering order is Pre Filter Carbon Filter HEPA filterWorking The air purifier can be set to different modes One of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor The pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular LED screen by means of circular rings of different colors Blue Min Violet Pink Red Max Red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automaticallyIf you are not a fan of the automatic mode you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speedmodes They areFan Speed Indicated by on the screenFan Speed Indicated by on the screenFan Speed Indicated by on the ScreenAutomatic Mode Indicated by A on the ScreenAllergen Mode This can be only added on top of Automatic Mode It essentially bumps up the speed a bit on all the different color levels This is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rateTurbo Mode Indicated by T on the Screen This puts the fan in the maximum speed possibleThats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier Additionally the filter has an automaticforced night mode The purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode The same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier What this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noiseSummary So as to summarize my review and add my view here the filter works pretty well for the use case i have On regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from Red levels to Blue Switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels On drastic pollution days it has a tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and i have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control If not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to a much acceptable levelsThe air quality indicator is a great value add on to the product Much that is missing in similar priced competitorsI am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise I believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible By reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days but is totally useless in any thing even a little worse when i dont want to use turbo mode just yetDurability of the filters has been decent I have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the HEPA or the Carbon Filter On yes that reminds me the Air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when a filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen It even does that for the prefilter which does not have to be replaced but just cleanedwashed That i have received times this past yearOverall i still strongly recommend this product Good performance with a decent price which has been slashed a good amount from when it launchedGood productThe product does not stand out notably but it probably does the work it is supposed to It is too late now to return this product and try another makeOver all good productbEasy to installWell designed product Yet to experience filter replacement and consequently the recurring costThe product is working nicely and worth buying productWriting after almost years all pros n cons Everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around and it took only months it become totally black few advice Dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked If you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners Seal your doors most dirt mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them Run it all day as when u turn it iff after hour your room will be as dirty as ut was You can clean pre filter only dont clean carbon and hepa filter Being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it times keep it under sun light for hours Sometimes u get error of FO clean all three filter with vaccume or brush careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working Bhai delhi m pollution bhot h so family k lie monthly rs padta h filter mother wife bachy pura din gher p rhty h so its a must buy to protect them Update fan speed got slow down Power consumption on st watt nd watt rd watt max watt best is keep it on automatic mode when room will be clean power consumption will reduced to watt and whole night it work in power efficient mode Do not left your room door or window open it

"Using it with my QC 3 Charger .So far- So good.A Quality cable with a sturdy construction & troublefree performance.,Awesome product go for buy it 👍,Execellent,Sturdy micro USB cable for Old phones,Super,Product description says 3 feet it's hardly a foot length wire.,Good,Excellent quality cable",ABOUT AMAZONBASICSxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in is Amazons own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goodsHere amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand already exist in the market but at lower prices Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable pricesIf something isnt an immediate hit Amazon pulls it and moves onAmazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers onlineAs an additional benefit Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined immediately taken care ofABOUT OUR PRODUCT REQUIREMENT vs ACTUALxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm Qbix car charger was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements DATA EXCHANGESince it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car Data exchange capability was not much of my concern Preference though would surely have been a USB but it didnt bother me if I could only get a USB tooACTUAL PRODUCT I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed LENGTH OF THE CABLE Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob I preferred to keep it short simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or belowACTUAL PRODUCT The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely meters or approximately feet long The length was sufficient for me to plugin any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passengers seat TANGLE FREE FLEXIBILITY STRENGTH STANDARDSI am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunchedACTUAL PRODUCT The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility reasonable thickness a sturdy intermediate cable The whole construction of the cable due its cable size flexibility is almost tanglefreeThe associated cable was not exactly thick but cant be termed as thin or delicate too Its not the thickest Ive seen but then thickest doesnt always means most durable Given my application its more than just suitableThe overall built quality of the cable insulation looks promising enough to last few years Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last longI had further shortlisted mansaa an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORSHad an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBsACTUAL PRODUCT There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spacesThe connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A micro B ports The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite goodNo signs of loose constructionBeing Goldplated is more of a misleading fancy termin this case as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways AVAILABILITY OF TIESVELCRO STRAPS As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice addon to properly adjust arrange the cable as per requirementACTUAL PRODUCT This I miss the most in the provided actual cable there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITYOn the newest QC certified chargers the current transmission can go up to amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling abilityACTUAL PRODUCT The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to amps against demands at new QC chargers that could go up to amps Here let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging thus it is not like a continuous flow of amps is there it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above amps would sufficiently work with QC chargersHave tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S from without the cable getting hot WARRANTYComes with a year warranty as expected Not the best in the industry but reasonableOTHER OBSERVATIONSApart from the above listed features the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are The cable is manufactured in China imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name philosophy of amazonbasics The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct it was imported to India in Dec The cable has a MRP tag of bucks however I purchased it online for bucksbeing a prime member shipping was free A customer care toll free number email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievancesFINAL VERDICTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received been using this product So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around I suppose its worth itWill surely update if any malfunction is observedWorth for buyThe quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination simply superb goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition Make in india is good but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers govt should infact encourage such competitionAmazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devicesAs an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesnt also disappointSupports fast charging for all my Samsung phonesI use Samsung apro Samsung splus which this cable is compatible with Very sturdy thick and very long ftVery affordable pricing Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung sfeSuperProduct charging is ok however its mere foot in length the vendor could have mentioned correct product description there is no need to mislead too early to say performance as I have received it todayGoodI have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs and Rs of ubon and of many other chinese local companiesand none of them worked properlyFinall i decided to go for thisAnd it is charging as well transferring data without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice Dont buy cheap chinese local cables ofYou will have to throw them in dustbean after some timeBetter buy this

youre getting calls continuously itll less the battery backupSound quality Sound quality in these earphones are amazingThe mids are crisp and clear the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but its that not punchybut dont you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy baseThe call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone These earphones have noise cancellation which works goodthe volume level on these earphones are really highi cannot go beyond Alright So I have been using Boult ProBass Curve for over a month and would like to summarize my feedback in bulletpoints to make it easy for the prospective buyers I was thinking to buy a quality Bluetooth headset with a great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended I was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then Moreover I found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling Its that time I started feeling the need of a wireless headset and began my search I took good time months to look for a good product And this is when I decided to purchase this item Before purchase I devoted time to read the users reviews that I always do before making any purchasesmall or big and found myself convinced Finally I decided to go for it Ok So no more essay writing Let me get straight to the key points I bought this for under Sale so saved INR its a good saving As Warrent Buffet says every penny saved is every penny earned This has great sound quality I could not compare it against any other product because I dont have any other bluetooth headset with me But this will surely not let you down It is very loud even at volume level You just cannot listen to at that level forget about full volume Bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either Good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to Excellent sound clarity I am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external soundnoise or very very minimal that is not noticeable So this stands perfect at this point Performs excellent while taking a call You will a get a crystal clear voice when you maketake a call using this device You will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone In fact its even better at times when the voice from the other side is low I really love the handsfree calling because I have to take long calls with the clients in my job Battery backup is excellent It can last anywhere from to hours I have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage And I mean it I tested it for almost a month with daywise log capture Please see the detailed tracking at the end It gets full charged in hours approx Bluetooth range is good It covers a distance of to feet easily Its quite enough if not good enough My figures may be wrong Beware Its just my rough estimate Havent tested is rigorously Design looks good and is very convenient to wear The wires are adjustable as per need This is a nice thing Looks cool when you wear it around your neck I chose Red color Last but not the least It comes with year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music Judgement Just go for it if you have a limited budget or dont want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset I was hesitant to spend anything beyond bucks on a bluetooth headset It was my personal limitationPS Battery

product is really very good sound quality durability battery performance is also very goodOverall its a fair productRs with all the featuresIts perfect for daily commute since it has a very good battery life it will last for to days easilyWhen it comes to the sound quality i feel its not delivering as advertised which is obvious It would be wrong to expect great sound from an overall product You cant have everything at once This is my personal opinion since i am a music enthusiast and have experienced music from great headphones and ear phonesOther than that its worth trying totally

"Let's bust some myth,IQOO Neo 6 5G – A midrange model that offers virtually everything I want",I ordered this phone based on specs it was providing later I saw flood of negative reviews coming up on Amazon which made me test few of things that was mentioned if it was true Calls getting disconnected I had call with my brother last night and we talked for min and call did not disconnect in the middle Heating issue While in day to day use never faced heating issue but It gets a little hot while charging I can understand because of massive fast charging which is understandable Every phone with fast charging heats a little Camera Quality It has a decent mp Samsung camera module which is justified at price it comes You can judge the camera based on how well it performs indoor with artificial lighting conditions and this has done good Attached pic of cake which I clicked indoor only bright light source was candle It performed well I can sayTo people who complaint about camera I just cannot expect picture clarity of Apple or Samsung high end devices i have to set my expectations right for the price we have paid AnTuTu Benchmark Score While company claim of while I tested i got a score of I again cannot complaint here because I dont know what was the testing conditions and criteria that company had followed while testing is pretty decent score I can say Phone lag In two days of testing it has not lagged at all With multiple background apps running Battery Drain Revisit few of the settings on your device like animation transition effect etc to get most out of your battery If your batter is set of monstor mode set it to normal or battery saver to make most Again battery depends of usage of individual and i cannot blame company While I started to write this review my cell phone was at Now its almost min typing till now its now showing i have set my screen at full brightness i fell its decent Also tested charging speed to in min Build quality Its sturdy and decent plastic is used I can say at this price point they should have provided glass build but again considering all price benefit you have got while buying this phone no complaint Card Discount Exchange Benefit etc Still I would take out star here Black colour issue Did not face any problem with screen leak or black colour Its AMOLED screen Black is highlight of AMOLED In case you were using IPS FHD panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing I have Samsung M as secondary device and i see black similar on both BGMI I played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag Two year warranty They calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only year I have personally wrote to Iqoo team and Amazon team seeking an answer with screenshots waiting for answerBTW majority of phone manufacturers provide year warranty only even iPhone Here I would say fight for you justice and seek answer from Iqoo or Amazon Team Video call lag Did not face any did multiple video calls yesterday with different people did not get any complaint from them about my video lag For all of them my video popped up instantaneousOverall I would say I had a great buy and can recommend this device to others for all the folks bombarding negative reviews I would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied In case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justiceOverall i give this device a star as of now since I am yet to test this device long term like months or monthsPlease excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any Entire review was typed on my phone Iqoo Neo I have been using a budget phone realme since dynamic black GBGB It served me well but it was time for an upgrade I was looking for a midrange model this time that would have almost everything I wanted within my budget Did I get one Lets dig into itTHE GOOD Price After discounts I got a phone with practically all the features I wanted IQOO is basically from Vivo an internationally recognized brand Hopefully I dont have to worry about software updates for at least years IQOO is already doing good as I have received security updates so far for the Android that came out of the box I will keep an eye on the security updates and OS upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for VivoIQOO for my next phone Dual G SIM support which is futuristic With G the call quality has been superb so far E AMOLED Hz nits peak x pixels display with contrast ratio Hz touch sampling rate and HDR Netflix HDR supported A huge upgrade from my previous phone The photos OTT movies look too good Easier to read contents like messages emails or documents MP main cam with OIS OIS was a musthave feature for me since I could be taking a lot of lowlight photos mAh battery with W FlashCharge Technology in min in min Works as claimed The battery life has been satisfactory SD CPU Not one of the flagship processors today but highly capable and fantastic at this price Inclusion of GB RAM has made this phone a butterysmooth one for running apps Android is quite a RAM dependent OS unlike iOS Up to GB of phone storage can be used for extended RAM Currently I have apps installed mostly productivity apps but no gaming apps The cascade cooling system seems to be working GB ROM with UFS Since phones nowadays tend to ditch a dedicated microSDXC slot and this phone is no exception I did not want the GB variant A fast large internal ROM is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps files slower The indisplay fingerprint reader works well The stereo speakers are reasonably good Infrared port IR blaster I have not tried using it as a remote but a must try USBC port with USBC to USBA data cable that connects to the phone charger Some of us prefer a USBC to USBC data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices but I can see why IQOO decided to provide a USBC to USBA Most laptops still come with USBA ports even my recent hp G laptop from the company I work for does have a USBC port without power delivery and two USBA ports My powerbanks dont have USBC ports either Screenshots lock screen virtual buttons Must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttonsTHE BAD Google backup A FAIL Since I did not have a USBC to USBC cable I had to choose the WiFi data transfer option from my old phone to this one Although I selected all the files Google failed to transfer many files especially the PDFs Dear Google this is unacceptable Spam handling My realme lets me block any SMS I want but this one does not In my opinion every modern phone must have a native app that can identify the caller and help block a number or an SMS as needed I have stopped using a rd party app like Truecaller which has become a truly rogue app No mm jack a plus when you dont have a bluetooth earphone or dont prefer one but IQOO thankfully included a USBC to mm adapter in the box The absence of gorilla glass protection is not a good thing but I do not mind as I barely drop my phone and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector and a transparent back cover Really appreciated The plastic body does not bother me moreover the dark nova color feels cool YMMV In my realme and not in my realme C which means it is a custom feature from realme for specific OS versions if I try turning off the daily wakeup alarm it gives me options like Turn off on the next day for which the alarm is active Do not repeat any more or Cancel This is a fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for a particular day say an upcoming leave or holiday without turning it off for the following days Unfortunately this artificial intelligence is not available in my IQOO Neo GAlways buy a recently released model if you are going for an Android phone This will make sure that you get software support for long enough time Moreover avoid buying the variant with lowest RAMROM And fast charging is a necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the timeI have used this phone for months and will update this review as I keep using it Till date I am quite satisfied with IQOO Neo G I also liked the Funtouch OS and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me,4.4,B07WDKLDRX,0,0,1,1,0,0,20,10,10,20,409.170.984.455.958
"A Quality Sound-Signature but leaves craving for a decent bass.Quite fragile too.Compared with Senn.HD 202 II & Sony MDR XB50AP.,boAt 225 vs JBL CS100 vs Sennheisers cx180 | DETAILED Comparison after 1 YEAR of USE.",For those looking for a genuine review a brief comparison summary between the best three earphonesheadphones in the budget segment Lets help you to makeup your mind The review is for Sennheiser S earphone but items for comparison are Sennheiser HD II over the ear headphone Sennheiser CX S In earphone Sony MDRXBAP in ear Extra Bass earphones Just for an introduction i would like to mention I am a dire fan for flagship Electronic goods manages to fulfill my passion for the Taste of quality from time to time Now lets begin When you start looking for earphones or headphones Sennheiser is definitely a brand worth to look for and rightly so The brand has acquired a great reputation of producing some top notch quality gears in its segment I too started my quest to purchase some of the best sounding earphones within reasonable limits of purchasing power excluding those insanely pricey onesRead some very good reviews of the Sennheiser HD II Professional OverEar Headphone from my fellow amazonians and bought itFound it to be reasonably good but having certain drawbacks may refer my review of HD at amazon which were not upto my tasteNext Unsettled I went to purchase these Sennheiiser CX S in earphones and here are my observationsDESIGN CONSTRUCTION a Looks feels delicate to hold with its extremely thin wires and if you are casual in handling frequently then in the long runits sure to failb Wires which are around m in expanse are not tangle free and keep getting into random knots each time you get to use itc Comes with different sized earpieces to snug fit different earanatomies and provides decent sound isolation but not the bestd Inconvincing design of the earpiece globes as the bottom tail piece below the earpiece was not large enough to grip with fingers to comfortably fit or adjust the earpieces in the ears and each time you had to twist the spherical globes to snug fite Comes with a gold plated Lshaped additional adapter for better fitment to laptops etcf Comes with a small pouch which for the most part was a useless accessory for me A case or box would have been more a more elegant option Squeezing the whole earphone into the lill pouch everytimenaah feels primitive but then its my own two piecesSOUND QUALITY PERFORMANCExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe sound quality is crisp clear with clear mids and crisp pitches bass was okayish but leaves you craving for more every time you plug itin to watch some movie or NATGEO documentariesThe lack of an adequate bass may even get unsettling sometimesThe frequency response as per specs was to Hz against to Hz of Sony MDRXBAPJust to quote Sonys bass could get really deep low with its mm drivers and neodymium magnets For purists senneheiser does its job quite honestly but in general as for sony A little makeup wont Hurt LOLSound quality is maintained till the maximum volume though it felt slightly that the mids succumbed to pitches at the apexVERDICT xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Lack of a decent bass extremely fragile design is unacceptable at a price range of bucks For me Not worth itDETAILS COMPARISON xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI happened to test the quality performance of

feel out of place at rare instances but never feels Cheap redundant or unpleasant to the ears Its a quality refined timbre bass not some low quality stuff HD bass was ok but then it had other issues with sound leaking from the pads and disturbing othersSOUND QUALITY xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxExcellent on all but Sony a bit appealing with its phenomenal immersive bassBUILD DESIGN xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Again SonySennHD SennCX S Sonys wire were tangle free earphone pieces felt indestructible noise isolation was UltimateNext was SennHD and least by any standards was SennCX SThe fragile design of the wires around Mic In sennCX may itself be a let alone discarding feature for many SennHD II might be good for gamers and watching from a distance with its long cord if leaking sound to outside world is not an issueBass is anytime better than SennCX S but not as mesmerising as SonySound quality though is very goodcrisp and clear SennCX S might be good for purists but even with its balanced Highs and midsSerious lack of bass keeps you longing for more especially if you are more into moviesgames and documentaries than musicMoreover its extremely fragile always tangling thin wires is a constant annoying feature Sony MDR XBAP gets the most evident and refined high quality deep bass with crisp high and quality midsIts indestructible unique design offers the best noise isolation of all and comes with the most sturdy tangle free wiresDo not consider higher bass as an adulteration to pure musicIts a quality bass with frequency response as low as to Hzadds a mesmerizing essence to the quality of sound which is absent on other twoProbably like a Super amoled with extra vivid colors that look more punchy full of lifeAnyways at the end of the day its your callkeep listeningNOTE There are thousands of reviews for this product but surprisingly theres hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL CSI and Sennhesiers CX so I would be comparing all these earphones in this review You get a L shaped connector in these earphones so note thatI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopicBUILT QUALITY boAt Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense Metal housing holds up good but colour sheds off after months Perfect L shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting JBL Small round cables shredding off after months of moderate usage Plastic housing doing great so farConnector is bent but not in perfect L shape so its quite pain to use while resting Sennheiser Small round cables holding up good after year of rough use Plastic housing has become slick as rubber coating on it has shredded off Perfect L shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting WINNER boAt COMFORT boAt comfortable enough when used while in upright position These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so Has very long earphone head JBL Comfortable enough in upright position Slightly uncomfortable using while resting as these have offset opening Sennheisers Comfortable in both the position These are apt for long duration usage WINNER sennheisers cx LOUDNESS CX boAt JBL CSSI boAt tends to distort above level of volume JBL Crystal clear even at full volume but has least sound level in all of three Sennheisers tends to distort above level of volume but has greater sound level of all WINNER sennheisers cx SOUND QUALITY Bass mids lows I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids lows which are strong Crisp But bass levels are different boAt has average bass I am very disappointed with it since these earphones are marketed as bassheads JBL has least bass of all I felt treble is high in these Sennheisers ton of bass and when used proper eartips its just a treat for bass lovers WINNER sennheisers cx SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL boAt I noticed in early few months quality over call was great but started to deplete after months But its still good not as good as new Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side JBL its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now Sennheisers their NO microphone lol PNOTE boAt JBL boths mics works with android and iOS perfectly WINNER boAt CUSTOMER CARE boAt Year warranty Had no issues till date so didnt got chance to check it But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences JBL Year warranty Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within weeks after contacting nearest service center Sennheisers Years warranty I had of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service centerNOTE I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service I would suggest this to all WINNER sennheiser cx CONNECTIVITY All the earphones have mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devicesVERDICT I dont think I need to explain anything else now since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones To sum up I would say boAt are good if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting then go for JBL CSSI But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me then certainly go for Sennheisers cxHope this review helps you make sound decision,4.1,B083T5G5PM,1,0,1,1,1,0,16,12,12,17,409.170.984.455.958
"THE PERFECT PHONE – FOR MY REQUIREMENTS,Galaxy M33 5G a mixed bag of Affordability",I would not consider buying an iphone simply because my friend owns two of them or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew both of whom are more tech savvy than me because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations which may differ from mine I am an oldfashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres megapixels and megabytes but I think of a cellphone as a utility item not a status symbol Applying a technocratic approach I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirementsMy foremost requirement which is entirely nonnegotiable is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil a phonebook with at least contacts basic net connectivity a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for hours or preferably hours at my normal level of usage Besides I would like to use a new handset for at least two yearsApart from exigencies I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet videoconferencing or sending emails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activitiesI am equally clear about what I do not need I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies reading books listening to music or creating fancy social media posts Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera At the risk of sounding flippant I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golfHaving used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years I vastly prefer the former My last phone which gave me over months of good service was a Samsung M Since that model is obsolete now I focused on its upgraded cousins M M and M The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card After studying the relative specifications of M and M I concluded that the latter offers better value for money Generally it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small With these considerations I narrowed down my choice to M with GB RAM and GB storage Just twenty years ago I was using a desktop with GB memoryAs a confirmation for my choice I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE GB RAM GB Storage which my son had recommended The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus productAs for body colour my first choice was Emerald Brown but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phoneDespite a strong family resemblance with my old one M the new phone M offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone but these differences are acceptable to me Thanks to the MP front camera and MP selfie camera the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about metres from the stage This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates which reduces the worries on these fronts Youtube reviewers complain that the M has plain looks it is heavy its audio does not offer an immersive listening experience and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings so long as the M meets my requirementsI was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers because old chargers like old handsets add to ewaste However it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers The recommended charger for M is watts but the chargers I had at home are rated at or wattsTo cut a long story short I ordered a watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time After using the new handset for a couple of weeks I find that my phone is at charge at the end of the day and it takes minutes for complete charging one of the useful features of M is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging It turns out that I could have managed with the old watt charger except that it would have taken minutes for full chargingI conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M g is the perfect phone but for my requirements A word of advice if you are planning to buy a new phone it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to useWith G connectivity a Hz display and solid performance the Galaxy M G is Samsungs bestvalue smartphone yet under K segmentProsAlmost half the price of Galaxy AExynos is a solid

is a plus herePD watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised major android OS updates and years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors making this device more value for money in long runConsUltrawide camera is on softer side lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details Note pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at kAmoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPreinstalled bloatwares like Moj dailyhunt sharechat byjus are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device but we can expect exynos to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design Chunky in size carries some heft Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer which adds up to the value cost

"DETAILED REVIEW with Best settings for better Sound output !!!,Worth if you know how to use and what to use it for.,Good for non-professional recordings,Buy this and start creating content for your youtube.,Long cable should be optional.... it's too long else good mic for beginners on YT,Working as expected,Nice product,Good 👍",NOTE Its ready to go Mic which doesnt need any sound card and can be plugged and used directly even with smartphones Has mm jack connector built in you can use connector if needed It has very Long cable which measures upto feet so note that It has absolutely NO noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in STOCK condition but with SIMPLE EDITING this mic works just fine Check the review below for detailed settings There are literally thousands of review on this product but NONE explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with Audacity software or even in general So I took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones So I went to search for best settings on amazon other sources but in vain Fortunately I myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fineFirst I am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that I found and then listing those settingsPROS Built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given Length of cable is insane feet I personally didnt find it useful as I use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with Camera Has universal mm jack which is handy Its easy to use just plug and play device which doesnt need any sound card or external device to work Has support for multiple device right from smartphones to DSLRs and computers It comes with carry pouch which is very handy since its a mess with such long cablesCONS Biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box Its just garbage quality and even normal ears cant bear the background noise collection so forget about audiophiles My normal smartphones earphones record much better sound quality compared to this Length of cable is way too much for me and I guess for many users I think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from as keeping feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable It comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and theres NO way to know whether the battery is dead or whats its charging level Only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test So if you are carrying it with recorder which doesnt has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me its very frustrating I am mentioning it as this scenario have happened with me once hence I am very cautious about batteries now use it with smartphones or digital recorders I think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less considering the sound qualityBEST SETTING USING AUDACITY SOFTWARE These are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use Audacity software which is Free Open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic Select entire audio clip and open Effects and then DISTORTION Start the playback of audio clip in the software so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to makeNow select Distortion Type option on the top of box and select Soft Clipping or select Hard Limiter and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you Take the Clipping Level cursor to extreme Right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output Adjust the Makeup Gain cursor little bit if needed I keep it on Here you can select which ever type which you feel is suitable for you Now just click APPLY Now is Noise reduction For that Select short section of audio which DOES NOT have your voice but ONLY has background noises that you dont want Open Effects and then Noise Reduction Click on Get Noise Profile Now select entire audio clip and again Open Effects and then Noise Reduction Finally click on OK and thats it Now you are good to go with soft slightly lesser Noises and more pleasant sound output After these steps you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user softwareVERDICT I personally am very disappointed with the sound quality though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level but its satisfactory enough Plus price seems slightly more on this I wouldnt recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment Buy this only if you live in very silent conditionsIts not great or best out there for beginners but goodI use a budget midrange phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone record it in WAV format its goodYou gotta use softwareapps to pull the best of this like audacity or some other editing appIts pretty long and thats good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripodOverall its decent for beginners I see highend phones have good recording capabilities but if you have a budget phone then this one is dealMicrophone looks very well built it supports both phones and cameras There are some phones that does not support external mic please check before buying as one of my phone did not support itThey claim noise cancellation however I did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone I could not observe noise cancellation at least while recording on phoneOverall package is well bundled wire quality is decent however the dongle quality is excellent even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solidWire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then stars from me but now star good sound low price star for wire quality but over all a nice productI think Its good for online teaching like I doBut yeah some problems like very long cable length I mean someone might need but it should be optional or detachable price of the Mic itself is not much anywaysI am okay with this mic for sometime until I am sure I need quality Rode mic to upgradeDont expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very goodNice productDecent,4,B076B8G5D8,1,1,1,1,2,1,20,12,13,22,409.170.984.455.958

a good enough job Main Camera mp is on par and better than Redmi note pro in almost all conditions retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with HDR in photos as well as videos it is able to handle extremely bright conditions wellEven in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colorsGood Stable videos at pk video recording is available at FPS is availableMany cool camera features boasts AR fun mode single Take Object Eraser and Video TNR Temporal Noise Reduction which makes it fun to use cameraSelfie camera has good punchy colors Samsungs way of boosted colour processing some may like it some may notExcellent battery life got hours of SOT despite the heavy usage It takes around hours to go from and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around provided you have watt Samsungs chargerDespite summer time phone has managed to stay relatively cool nm architecture helping its cause here G BandsDedicated SD card slot is a plus herePD watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised major android OS updates and years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors making this device more value for money in long runConsUltrawide camera is on softer side lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details Note pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at kAmoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPreinstalled bloatwares like Moj dailyhunt sharechat byjus are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device but we can expect exynos to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design Chunky in size carries some heft Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer which adds up to the value cost

"Great keyboard, average mouse.,Good for daily use,Mouse is too small in size to use and getting pain,Must buy this for normal use,Noisy and not Ergonomic,Great Product,Well suited for ordinary and official usage.,Nice Product",EDIT This doesnt change my review actually it probably makes it lean even heavier towards the star than star rating but I actually sat on the keyboard while it was on my chair Im an absolute unit of a dude weighing kg and the keyboard wasnt affected at all Im genuinely surprisedFirst of all Id give this a instead of the but I rounded it up instead of down because theres more to like than dislikeProduct was delivered promptly but the packaging was in rough shape When I unpacked it the keyboard had three missing keys iirc it was left Alt Z and the Windows keys I turned over the box and dumped everything and voila The missing keys fell out Not off to a great start but I slapped those keys on which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy and plugged in the receiver to my laptop No setup or rd party software necessary it just started working instantly Pretty seamlessI only use the keyboard when I connect my laptop to my TV and Im sitting at a distance I use my laptops keyboard otherwise I absolutely love the keyboard I was expecting it to feel wonky and cheap but it actually feels decent Its not super premium but its much better than what I was expecting for the price It has flip stands on the back to raise it and an onoff switch if you want to conserve battery The keys themselves are full sized and as someone with larger hands I really appreciate it The curve around the space bar looks cool but I dont think it adds anything ergonomically The typing experience is nice the keys have enough feedback to them not mechanical levels obviously but still satisfying enough The Caps Lock key has a little raised bit to it so you can feel it without looking at it and dont accidentally hit it while typing neat little addition The shortcutmedia keys on top all work fine with Windows Theres not much else to say about the keyboard It should be more than sufficient for everyday officebrowsingschool tasks and will be good and comfy for people who type a lot Do not buy this expecting a gaming level keyboard with antighosting etc or buy it expecting to have the durability of a true mechanical keyboard I was initially going to mark it down for not having any backlight at all but given the budget thats understandable and acceptable Overall I very much like the keyboard and find it to be above par for what you payThe mouse on the other hand no pun intended is mediocre at best The build quality is not good it does not feel good when you use either of the click buttons you can feel the inner mechanisms groaning like its gonna fall apart at any time The mouse also starts lagging randomly The lag only lasts a couple of seconds but it occurs enough to be an annoyance Also it just doesnt feel good in your palm I have an Amazon Basics mouse that I purchased while I was in the US for rs and that thing feels so much sturdier and better built than this It also has no lagging issues and the clicks feel smooth even after a few years of useAs an overall package I would say its decent for the price There are lots of other sets in this price range and I picked this literally because of the Logitech branding since I own a few other Logitech products and enjoy them a lot The keyboard is doing all the heavy lifting here and carrying its mouse friend I hope they improve the mouse going forward because then this would be the best combo in this range As it stands right now its fairly indistinguishable from its competitorsRecommended for people looking for an affordable wireless set for everyday computer work and people who type a lotNot recommended for gaming or any form of power users It might work for single player games like city builders grand strategy RTSes etc but I would not recommend it for any form of shooters especially online The mouse simply isnt up to taskThe Keyboard is good and working nice for me the Mouse is too small and not able to use properly and getting pain after using for very less time only it will be good if the mouse is in regular size Also the mouse is lagging a bit even after changing the settingsI using this product since one year not any problem foundEven battery cell not changeI dont really know if its worth the cost or not But I mainly prefer silent typing and mouse clicks Ergonomic is also a must as I use these for long hoursCurrently I use logitech m mouse which is really awesome and makes almost no noise at allGreat ProductI have been using this product for years Its battery is great still running The keys could get hard with time therefore i had to use WD to lubricate them After years some random keys have stopped working such Del Semicolon Numpad The mouses right click isnt functioning anymore The left click has irritating double click issue So not suited for FPS games Speed and connection is adequate no lag noticed The keyboard collects a lot of dust so better to cover it Ergonomics are great no issue with that If youre looking for a longer size keyboard for approx years of proper functioning for daily or official use then it is a good purchase Mouse is small and comfortable even for left handed people Keep in mind the keys WILL become stiff over timeI purchased it for my personal use which includes mostly working it has good connectivity both for keyboard and mouse I have not faced any issue with it I have not tested its performanace,4.2,B00CEQEGPI,1,1,1,1,1,1,18,12,13,19,409.170.984.455.958
